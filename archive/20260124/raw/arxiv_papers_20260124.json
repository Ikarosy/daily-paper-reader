    "abstract": "Recent advances in camera-controlled video diffusion models have significantly improved video-camera alignment. However, the camera controllability still remains limited. In this work, we build upon Reward Feedback Learning and aim to further improve camera controllability. However, directly borrowing existing ReFL approaches faces several challenges. First, current reward models lack the capacity to assess video-camera alignment. Second, decoding latent into RGB videos for reward computation introduces substantial computational overhead. Third, 3D geometric information is typically neglected during video decoding. To address these limitations, we introduce an efficient camera-aware 3D decoder that decodes video latent into 3D representations for reward quantization. Specifically, video latent along with the camera pose are decoded into 3D Gaussians. In this process, the camera pose not only acts as input, but also serves as a projection parameter. Misalignment between the video latent and camera pose will cause geometric distortions in the 3D structure, resulting in blurry renderings. Based on this property, we explicitly optimize pixel-level consistency between the rendered novel views and ground-truth ones as reward. To accommodate the stochastic nature, we further introduce a visibility term that selectively supervises only deterministic regions derived via geometric warping. Extensive experiments conducted on RealEstate10K and WorldScore benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

    "abstract": "Robot foundation models are beginning to deliver on the promise of generalist robotic agents, yet progress remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale real-world manipulation datasets. Simulation and synthetic data generation offer a scalable alternative, but their usefulness is limited by the visual domain gap between simulation and reality. In this work, we present Point Bridge, a framework that leverages unified, domain-agnostic point-based representations to unlock synthetic datasets for zero-shot sim-to-real policy transfer, without explicit visual or object-level alignment. Point Bridge combines automated point-based representation extraction via Vision-Language Models (VLMs), transformer-based policy learning, and efficient inference-time pipelines to train capable real-world manipulation agents using only synthetic data. With additional co-training on small sets of real demonstrations, Point Bridge further improves performance, substantially outperforming prior vision-based sim-and-real co-training methods. It achieves up to 44% gains in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and up to 66% with limited real data across both single-task and multitask settings.

    "abstract": "We study Compositional Video Understanding (CVU), where models must recognize verbs and objects and compose them to generalize to unseen combinations. We find that existing Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition (ZS-CAR) models fail primarily due to an overlooked failure mode: object-driven verb shortcuts. Through systematic analysis, we show that this behavior arises from two intertwined factors: severe sparsity and skewness of compositional supervision, and the asymmetric learning difficulty between verbs and objects. As training progresses, the existing ZS-CAR model increasingly ignores visual evidence and overfits to co-occurrence statistics. Consequently, the existing model does not gain the benefit of compositional recognition in unseen verb-object compositions. To address this, we propose RCORE, a simple and effective framework that enforces temporally grounded verb learning. RCORE introduces (i) a composition-aware augmentation that diversifies verb-object combinations without corrupting motion cues, and (ii) a temporal order regularization loss that penalizes shortcut behaviors by explicitly modeling temporal structure. Across two benchmarks, Sth-com and our newly constructed EK100-com, RCORE significantly improves unseen composition accuracy, reduces reliance on co-occurrence bias, and achieves consistently positive compositional gaps. Our findings reveal object-driven shortcuts as a critical limiting factor in ZS-CAR and demonstrate that addressing them is essential for robust compositional video understanding.",

    "abstract": "Discrete video VAEs underpin modern text-to-video generation and video understanding systems, yet existing tokenizers typically learn visual codebooks at a single scale with limited vocabularies and shallow language supervision, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and zero-shot transfer. We introduce PyraTok, a language-aligned pyramidal tokenizer that learns semantically structured discrete latents across multiple spatiotemporal resolutions. PyraTok builds on a pretrained video VAE and a novel Language aligned Pyramidal Quantization (LaPQ) module that discretizes encoder features at several depths using a shared large binary codebook, yielding compact yet expressive video token sequences. To tightly couple visual tokens with language, PyraTok jointly optimizes multi-scale text-guided quantization and a global autoregressive objective over the token hierarchy. Across ten benchmarks, PyraTok delivers state-of-the-art (SOTA) video reconstruction, consistently improves text-to-video quality, and sets new SOTA zero-shot performance on video segmentation, temporal action localization, and video understanding, scaling robustly to up to 4K/8K resolutions.",

    "title": "Scaling Text-to-Image Diffusion Transformers with Representation Autoencoders",
    "abstract": "Representation Autoencoders (RAEs) have shown distinct advantages in diffusion modeling on ImageNet by training in high-dimensional semantic latent spaces. In this work, we investigate whether this framework can scale to large-scale, freeform text-to-image (T2I) generation. We first scale RAE decoders on the frozen representation encoder (SigLIP-2) beyond ImageNet by training on web, synthetic, and text-rendering data, finding that while scale improves general fidelity, targeted data composition is essential for specific domains like text. We then rigorously stress-test the RAE design choices originally proposed for ImageNet. Our analysis reveals that scaling simplifies the framework: while dimension-dependent noise scheduling remains critical, architectural complexities such as wide diffusion heads and noise-augmented decoding offer negligible benefits at scale Building on this simplified framework, we conduct a controlled comparison of RAE against the state-of-the-art FLUX VAE across diffusion transformer scales from 0.5B to 9.8B parameters. RAEs consistently outperform VAEs during pretraining across all model scales. Further, during finetuning on high-quality datasets, VAE-based models catastrophically overfit after 64 epochs, while RAE models remain stable through 256 epochs and achieve consistently better performance. Across all experiments, RAE-based diffusion models demonstrate faster convergence and better generation quality, establishing RAEs as a simpler and stronger foundation than VAEs for large-scale T2I generation. Additionally, because both visual understanding and generation can operate in a shared representation space, the multimodal model can directly reason over generated latents, opening new possibilities for unified models.",

    "abstract": "Many Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models flatten image patches into a 1D token sequence, weakening the 2D spatial cues needed for precise manipulation. We introduce IVRA, a lightweight, training-free method that improves spatial understanding by exploiting affinity hints already available in the model's built-in vision encoder, without requiring any external encoder or retraining. IVRA selectively injects these affinity signals into a language-model layer in which instance-level features reside. This inference-time intervention realigns visual-token interactions and better preserves geometric structure while keeping all model parameters fixed. We demonstrate the generality of IVRA by applying it to diverse VLA architectures (LLaRA, OpenVLA, and FLOWER) across simulated benchmarks spanning both 2D and 3D manipulation (VIMA and LIBERO) and on various real-robot tasks. On 2D VIMA, IVRA improves average success by +4.2% over the baseline LLaRA in a low-data regime. On 3D LIBERO, it yields consistent gains over the OpenVLA and FLOWER baselines, including improvements when baseline accuracy is near saturation (96.3% to 97.1%).

We first demonstrate that strong LLMs, without additional training, exhibit generalization capabilities to leverage the code sandbox for non-code tasks. For example, LLMs spontaneously access external resources to acquire new knowledge, leverage the file system to handle long contexts, and execute scripts to satisfy formatting requirements. We further show that these agentic capabilities can be enhanced through LLM-in-Sandbox Reinforcement Learning (LLM-in-Sandbox-RL), which uses only non-agentic data to train models for sandbox exploration. Experiments demonstrate that LLM-in-Sandbox, in both training-free and post-trained settings, achieves robust generalization spanning mathematics, physics, chemistry, biomedicine, long-context understanding, and instruction following. Finally, we analyze LLM-in-Sandbox's efficiency from computational and system perspectives, and open-source it as a Python package to facilitate real-world deployment.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel training regime termed counterfactual training that leverages counterfactual explanations to increase the explanatory capacity of models. Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a popular post-hoc explanation method for opaque machine learning models: they inform how factual inputs would need to change in order for a model to produce some desired output. To be useful in real-world decision-making systems, counterfactuals should be plausible with respect to the underlying data and actionable with respect to the feature mutability constraints. Much existing research has therefore focused on developing post-hoc methods to generate counterfactuals that meet these desiderata. In this work, we instead hold models directly accountable for the desired end goal: counterfactual training employs counterfactuals during the training phase to minimize the divergence between learned representations and plausible, actionable explanations. We demonstrate empirically and theoretically that our proposed method facilitates training models that deliver inherently desirable counterfactual explanations and additionally exhibit improved adversarial robustness.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong capabilities across diverse applications, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that distort their feature representations and induce erroneous predictions. To address this vulnerability, we propose the Feature-space Smoothing (FS) and theoretically prove that FS offers certified robustness on the feature representations of MLLMs. Specifically, FS transforms any feature encoder into a smoothed variant that is guaranteed to maintain a certified lower bound on the feature cosine similarity between clean and adversarial representations under $\\ell_2$-bounded attacks. Moreover, we indicate that the value of this Feature Cosine Similarity Bound (FCSB) derived from FS can be improved by enlarging the defined Gaussian robustness score on the vanilla encoder. Building upon this, we introduce the Purifier and Smoothness Mapper (PSM), a plug-and-play module that improves the Gaussian robustness score of MLLMs and thus enhances their certified robustness under FS, without requiring any retraining on MLLMs. We demonstrate that the FS with PSM not only provides a strong theoretical robustness guarantee but also exhibits superior empirical performance compared to adversarial training. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs and downstream tasks indicate the effectiveness of the FS-PSM, reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of various white-box attacks from nearly 90\\% to about 1\\%.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the multi-compartment vehicle routing problem with multiple time windows (MCVRPMTW), an extension of the classical vehicle routing problem with time windows that considers vehicles equipped with multiple compartments and customers requiring service across several delivery time windows. The problem incorporates three key compartment-related features: (i) compartment flexibility in the number of compartments, (ii) item-to-compartment compatibility, and (iii) item-to-item compatibility. The problem also accommodates practical operational requirements such as driver breaks. To solve the MCVRPMTW, we develop an exact branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm in which the pricing problem is solved using a labeling algorithm. Several acceleration strategies are introduced to limit symmetry during label extensions, improve the stability of dual solutions in column generation, and enhance the branching process. To handle large-scale instances, we propose a rolling-space B&P algorithm that integrates clustering techniques into the solution framework. Extensive computational experiments on instances inspired by a real-world industrial application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and provide useful managerial insights for practical implementation.",

    "abstract": "Lifting perspective images and videos to 360° panoramas enables immersive 3D world generation. Existing approaches often rely on explicit geometric alignment between the perspective and the equirectangular projection (ERP) space. Yet, this requires known camera metadata, obscuring the application to in-the-wild data where such calibration is typically absent or noisy. We propose 360Anything, a geometry-free framework built upon pre-trained diffusion transformers. By treating the perspective input and the panorama target simply as token sequences, 360Anything learns the perspective-to-equirectangular mapping in a purely data-driven way, eliminating the need for camera information. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both image and video perspective-to-360° generation, outperforming prior works that use ground-truth camera information. We also trace the root cause of the seam artifacts at ERP boundaries to zero-padding in the VAE encoder, and introduce Circular Latent Encoding to facilitate seamless generation. Finally, we show competitive results in zero-shot camera FoV and orientation estimation benchmarks, demonstrating 360Anything's deep geometric understanding and broader utility in computer vision tasks.

    "abstract": "We propose average unfairness as a new measure of fairness in routing games, defined as the ratio between the average latency and the minimum latency experienced by users. This measure is a natural complement to two existing unfairness notions: loaded unfairness, which compares maximum and minimum latencies of routes with positive flow, and user equilibrium (UE) unfairness, which compares maximum latency with the latency of a Nash equilibrium. We show that the worst-case values of all three unfairness measures coincide and are characterized by a steepness parameter intrinsic to the latency function class. We show that average unfairness is always no greater than loaded unfairness, and the two measures are equal only when the flow is fully fair. Besides that, we offer a complete comparison of the three unfairness measures, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first theoretical analysis in this direction. Finally, we study the constrained system optimum (CSO) problem, where one seeks to minimize total latency subject to an upper bound on unfairness. We prove that, for the same tolerance level, the optimal flow under an average unfairness constraint achieves lower total latency than any flow satisfying a loaded unfairness constraint. We show that such improvement is always strict in parallel-link networks and establish sufficient conditions for general networks. We further illustrate the latter with numerical examples. Our results provide theoretical guarantees and valuable insights for evaluating fairness-efficiency tradeoffs in network routing.",

We perform reinforcement learning at test time, so the LLM can continue to train, but now with experience specific to the test problem. This form of continual learning is quite special, because its goal is to produce one great solution rather than many good ones on average, and to solve this very problem rather than generalize to other problems. Therefore, our learning objective and search subroutine are designed to prioritize the most promising solutions. We call this method Test-Time Training to Discover (TTT-Discover). Following prior work, we focus on problems with continuous rewards. We report results for every problem we attempted, across mathematics, GPU kernel engineering, algorithm design, and biology. TTT-Discover sets the new state of the art in almost all of them: (i) Erdős' minimum overlap problem and an autocorrelation inequality; (ii) a GPUMode kernel competition (up to $2\\times$ faster than prior art); (iii) past AtCoder algorithm competitions; and (iv) denoising problem in single-cell analysis. Our solutions are reviewed by experts or the organizers. All our results are achieved with an open model, OpenAI gpt-oss-120b, and can be reproduced with our publicly available code, in contrast to previous best results that required closed frontier models.

In this work, we challenge this implicit assumption and argue that reliability should be regarded as a first-class property of learned representations themselves. We propose a principled framework for reliable representation learning that explicitly models representation-level uncertainty and leverages structural constraints as inductive biases to regularize the space of feasible representations. Our approach introduces uncertainty-aware regularization directly in the representation space, encouraging representations that are not only predictive but also stable, well-calibrated, and robust to noise and structural perturbations. Structural constraints, such as sparsity, relational structure, or feature-group dependencies, are incorporated to define meaningful geometry and reduce spurious variability in learned representations, without assuming fully correct or noise-free structure. Importantly, the proposed framework is independent of specific model architectures and can be integrated with a wide range of representation learning methods.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art neural theorem provers like DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 combine large language models with reinforcement learning, achieving impressive results through sophisticated training. We ask: do these highly-trained models still benefit from simple structural guidance at inference time? We evaluate a lightweight intervention -- a fixed prompt schedule over 15 common tactic skeletons -- on the miniF2F benchmark. This simple approach yields 21.7% pass@16 compared to 15.2% for standard sampling from the same model, a 43% relative improvement using the same number of samples (k=16) and same maximum generation length (1024 tokens). Our results suggest that even capable RL-trained provers underutilize structural priors available in the tactic language, and that simple inference-time guidance remains a cheap, complementary boost.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid quantum-HPC algorithms advance research by delegating complex tasks to quantum processors and using HPC systems to orchestrate workflows and complementary computations. Sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) is a hybrid quantum-HPC method in which information from a molecular Hamiltonian is encoded into a quantum circuit for evaluation on a quantum computer. A set of measurements on the quantum computer yields electronic configurations that are filtered on the classical computer, which also performs diagonalization on the selected subspace and identifies configurations to be carried over to the next step in an iterative process. Diagonalization is the most demanding task for the classical computer. Previous studies used the Fugaku supercomputer and a highly scalable diagonalization code designed for CPUs. In this work, we describe our efforts to enable efficient scalable and portable diagonalization on heterogeneous systems using GPUs as the main compute engines based on the previous work.   GPUs provide massive on-device thread-level parallelism that is well aligned with the algorithms used for diagonalization. We focus on the computation of ground-state energies and wavefunctions using the Davidson algorithm with a selected set of electron configurations. We describe the offload strategy, code transformations, and data-movement, with examples of measurements on the Frontier supercomputer and five other GPU accelerated systems. Our measurements show that GPUs provide an outstanding performance boost of order 100x on a per-node basis. This dramatically expedites the diagonalization step-essential for extracting ground and excited state energies-bringing the classical processing time down from hours to minutes.",

    "abstract": "Recent video generation models demonstrate remarkable ability to capture complex physical interactions and scene evolution over time. To leverage their spatiotemporal priors, robotics works have adapted video models for policy learning but introduce complexity by requiring multiple stages of post-training and new architectural components for action generation. In this work, we introduce Cosmos Policy, a simple approach for adapting a large pretrained video model (Cosmos-Predict2) into an effective robot policy through a single stage of post-training on the robot demonstration data collected on the target platform, with no architectural modifications. Cosmos Policy learns to directly generate robot actions encoded as latent frames within the video model's latent diffusion process, harnessing the model's pretrained priors and core learning algorithm to capture complex action distributions. Additionally, Cosmos Policy generates future state images and values (expected cumulative rewards), which are similarly encoded as latent frames, enabling test-time planning of action trajectories with higher likelihood of success. In our evaluations, Cosmos Policy achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LIBERO and RoboCasa simulation benchmarks (98.5% and 67.1% average success rates, respectively) and the highest average score in challenging real-world bimanual manipulation tasks, outperforming strong diffusion policies trained from scratch, video model-based policies, and state-of-the-art vision-language-action models fine-tuned on the same robot demonstrations. Furthermore, given policy rollout data, Cosmos Policy can learn from experience to refine its world model and value function and leverage model-based planning to achieve even higher success rates in challenging tasks.

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of internet of things (IoT) devices have created a pervasive ecosystem where encrypted wireless communications serve as the primary privacy and security protection mechanism. While encryption effectively protects message content, packet metadata and statistics inadvertently expose device identities and user contexts. Various studies have exploited raw packet statistics and their visual representations for device fingerprinting and identification. However, these approaches remain confined to the spatial domain with limited feature representation. Therefore, this paper presents CONTEX-T, a novel framework that exploits contextual privacy vulnerabilities using spectral representation of encrypted wireless traffic for IoT device characterization. The experiments show that spectral analysis provides new and rich feature representation for covert reconnaissance attacks, revealing a complex and expanding threat landscape that would require robust countermeasures for IoT security management. CONTEXT-T first transforms raw packet length sequences into time-frequency spectral representations and then utilizes transformer-based spectral analysis for the device identification. We systematically evaluated multiple spectral representation techniques and transformer-based models across encrypted traffic samples from various IoT devices. CONTEXT-T effectively exploited privacy vulnerabilities and achieved device classification accuracy exceeding 99% across all devices while remaining completely passive and undetectable.",

    "abstract": "Keyword Spotting (KWS) systems with small footprint models deployed on edge devices face significant accuracy and robustness challenges due to domain shifts caused by varying noise and recording conditions. To address this, we propose a comprehensive framework for continual learning designed to adapt to new domains while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed pipeline integrates a dual-input Convolutional Neural Network, utilizing both Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Mel-spectrogram features, supported by a multi-stage denoising process, involving discrete wavelet transform and spectral subtraction techniques, plus model and prototype update blocks. Unlike prior methods that restrict updates to specific layers, our approach updates the complete quantized model, made possible due to compact model architecture. A subset of input samples are selected during runtime using class prototypes and confidence-driven filtering, which are then pseudo-labeled and combined with rehearsal buffer for incremental model retraining. Experimental results on noisy test dataset demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, achieving 99.63\\% accuracy on clean data and maintaining robust performance (exceeding 94\\% accuracy) across diverse noisy environments, even at -10 dB Signal-to-Noise Ratio. The proposed framework work confirms that integrating efficient denoising with prototype-based continual learning enables KWS models to operate autonomously and robustly in resource-constrained, dynamic environments.",

    "abstract": "Many combinatorial optimization problems can be formulated as finding as assignment that maximized some pseudo-Boolean function (that we call the fitness function). Strict local search starts with some assignment and follows some update rule to proceed to an adjacent assignment of strictly higher fitness. This means that strict local search algorithms follow ascents in the fitness landscape of the pseudo-Boolean function. The complexity of the pseudo-Boolean function (and the fitness landscapes that it represents) can be parameterized by properties of the valued constraint satisfaction problem (VCSP) that encodes the pseudo-Boolean function. We focus on properties of the constraint graphs of the VCSP, with the intuition that spare graphs are less complex than dense ones. Specifically, we argue that pathwidth is the natural sparsity parameter for understanding limits on the power of strict local search. We show that prior constructions of sparse VCSPs where all ascents are exponentially long had pathwidth greater than or equal to four. We improve this this with our controlled doubling construction: a valued constraint satisfaction problem of pathwidth three where all ascents are exponentially long from a designated initial assignment. From this, we conclude that all strict local search algorithms can be forced to take an exponential number of steps even on simple valued constraint graphs of pathwidth three.",

However, current methods often suffer from \"blind\" feature interaction, where the model struggles to discern key visual information from background noise due to the sparsity of textual queries. To bridge this gap, we draw inspiration from human cognitive behavior and propose the Human Vision-Driven (HVD) model. Our framework establishes a coarse-to-fine alignment mechanism comprising two key components: the Frame Features Selection Module (FFSM) and the Patch Features Compression Module (PFCM). FFSM mimics the human macro-perception ability by selecting key frames to eliminate temporal redundancy. Subsequently, PFCM simulates micro-perception by aggregating patch features into salient visual entities through an advanced attention mechanism, enabling precise entity-level matching. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that HVD not only captures human-like visual focus but also achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "Modern data systems increasingly operate under conditions of persistent legal, political, and analytic disagreement. In such settings, interoperability cannot rely on shared interpretation, negotiated semantics, or centralized authority. Instead, representations must function as neutral substrates that preserve stable reference across incompatible extensions. This paper investigates the structural constraints imposed on ontological design by this requirement. Building on a neutrality framework that treats interpretive non-commitment and stability under extension as explicit design constraints, we ask what minimal ontological structure is forced if accountability relationships are to remain referable and comparable under disagreement. Minimality here is not mere parsimony: a reduction is admissible only if it does not reintroduce stability-critical distinctions as hidden roles, flags, or contextual predicates. We establish a conditional lower-bound result: any ontology capable of supporting accountability under persistent disagreement must realize at least six distinct identity-and-persistence regimes. We further show that a construction with exactly six such regimes is sufficient to satisfy the stated requirements without embedding causal or normative commitments in the substrate. The result is not a proposal for a universal ontology, but a constraint on what is possible when neutrality and stable reference are treated as non-negotiable design goals.",

    "abstract": "Melodic harmonization, the task of generating harmonic accompaniments for a given melody, remains a central challenge in computational music generation. Recent single encoder transformer approaches have framed harmonization as a masked sequence modeling problem, but existing training curricula inspired by discrete diffusion often result in weak (cross) attention between melody and harmony. This leads to limited exploitation of melodic cues, particularly in out-of-domain contexts. In this work, we introduce a training curriculum, FF (full-to-full), which keeps all harmony tokens masked for several training steps before progressively unmasking entire sequences during training to strengthen melody-harmony interactions. We systematically evaluate this approach against prior curricula across multiple experimental axes, including temporal quantization (quarter vs. sixteenth note), bar-level vs. time-signature conditioning, melody representation (full range vs. pitch class), and inference-time unmasking strategies. Models are trained on the HookTheory dataset and evaluated both in-domain and on a curated collection of jazz standards, using a comprehensive set of metrics that assess chord progression structure, harmony-melody alignment, and rhythmic coherence. Results demonstrate that the proposed FF curriculum consistently outperforms baselines in nearly all metrics, with particularly strong gains in out-of-domain evaluations where harmonic adaptability to novel melodic queues is crucial. We further find that quarter-note quantization, intertwining of bar tokens, and pitch-class melody representations are advantageous in the FF setting. Our findings highlight the importance of training curricula in enabling effective melody conditioning and suggest that full-to-full unmasking offers a robust strategy for single encoder harmonization.",

    "abstract": "Generating animated 3D objects is at the heart of many applications, yet most advanced works are typically difficult to apply in practice because of their limited setup, their long runtime, or their limited quality. We introduce ActionMesh, a generative model that predicts production-ready 3D meshes \"in action\" in a feed-forward manner. Drawing inspiration from early video models, our key insight is to modify existing 3D diffusion models to include a temporal axis, resulting in a framework we dubbed \"temporal 3D diffusion\". Specifically, we first adapt the 3D diffusion stage to generate a sequence of synchronized latents representing time-varying and independent 3D shapes. Second, we design a temporal 3D autoencoder that translates a sequence of independent shapes into the corresponding deformations of a pre-defined reference shape, allowing us to build an animation. Combining these two components, ActionMesh generates animated 3D meshes from different inputs like a monocular video, a text description, or even a 3D mesh with a text prompt describing its animation. Besides, compared to previous approaches, our method is fast and produces results that are rig-free and topology consistent, hence enabling rapid iteration and seamless applications like texturing and retargeting. We evaluate our model on standard video-to-4D benchmarks (Consistent4D, Objaverse) and report state-of-the-art performances on both geometric accuracy and temporal consistency, demonstrating that our model can deliver animated 3D meshes with unprecedented speed and quality.",

Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a promising pretraining approach that enables effective transfer learning with limited labelled data. However, existing CL frameworks either focus solely on global context or fail to exploit ECG-specific characteristics. Furthermore, these methods rely on hard contrastive targets, which may not adequately capture the continuous nature of feature similarity in ECG signals. In this paper, we propose Beat-SSL, a contrastive learning framework that performs dual-context learning through both rhythm-level and heartbeat-level contrasting with soft targets. We evaluated our pretrained model on two downstream tasks: 1) multilabel classification for global rhythm assessment, and 2) ECG segmentation to assess its capacity to learn representations across both contexts. We conducted an ablation study and compared the best configuration with three other methods, including one ECG foundation model. Despite the foundation model's broader pretraining, Beat-SSL reached 93% of its performance in multilabel classification task and surpassed all other methods in the segmentation task by 4%.",

    "abstract": "The low-altitude economy (LAE) is an emerging economic paradigm which fosters integrated development across multiple fields. As a pivotal component of the LAE, low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) can restore communication by serving as aerial relays between the post-disaster areas and remote base stations (BSs). However, conventional approaches face challenges from vulnerable long-distance links between the UAVs and remote BSs, and data bottlenecks arising from massive data volumes and limited onboard UAV resources. In this work, we investigate a low-altitude multi-UAV-assisted data collection and semantic forwarding network, in which multiple UAVs collect data from ground users, form clusters, perform intra-cluster data aggregation with semantic extraction, and then cooperate as virtual antenna array (VAAs) to transmit the extracted semantic information to a remote BS via collaborative beamforming (CB). We formulate a data collection and semantic forwarding multi-objective optimization problem (DCSFMOP) that jointly maximizes both the user and semantic transmission rates while minimizing UAV energy consumption. The formulated DCSFMOP is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem that is inherently NP-hard and characterized by dynamically varying decision variable dimensionality. To address these challenges, we propose a large language model-enabled alternating optimization approach (LLM-AOA), which effectively handles the complex search space and variable dimensionality by optimizing different subsets of decision variables through tailored optimization strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that LLM-AOA outperforms AOA by approximately 26.8\\% and 22.9\\% in transmission rate and semantic rate, respectively.",

We focus on the situation in which the functions of interest are not known precisely but can only be approximated. As a first contribution we generalize an iteration scheme called dampened Mann iteration, recently introduced in the literature. The improved scheme relaxes previous constraints on parameter sequences, allowing learning rates to converge to zero or not converge at all. While seemingly minor, this flexibility is essential to enable the implementation of chaotic iterations, where only a subset of components is updated in each step, allowing to tackle higher-dimensional problems. Additionally, by allowing learning rates to converge to zero, we can relax conditions on the convergence speed of function approximations, making the method more adaptable to various scenarios. We also show that dampened Mann iteration applies immediately to compute the expected payoff in various probabilistic models, including simple stochastic games, not covered by previous work.",

    "abstract": "Existing approaches for watermarking AI-generated images often rely on post-hoc methods applied in pixel space, introducing computational overhead and potential visual artifacts. In this work, we explore latent space watermarking and introduce DistSeal, a unified approach for latent watermarking that works across both diffusion and autoregressive models. Our approach works by training post-hoc watermarking models in the latent space of generative models. We demonstrate that these latent watermarkers can be effectively distilled either into the generative model itself or into the latent decoder, enabling in-model watermarking. The resulting latent watermarks achieve competitive robustness while offering similar imperceptibility and up to 20x speedup compared to pixel-space baselines. Our experiments further reveal that distilling latent watermarkers outperforms distilling pixel-space ones, providing a solution that is both more efficient and more robust.",

    "title": "On the Intrinsic Dimensions of Data in Kernel Learning",
    "abstract": "The manifold hypothesis suggests that the generalization performance of machine learning methods improves significantly when the intrinsic dimension of the input distribution's support is low. In the context of KRR, we investigate two alternative notions of intrinsic dimension. The first, denoted $d_ρ$, is the upper Minkowski dimension defined with respect to the canonical metric induced by a kernel function $K$ on a domain $Ω$. The second, denoted $d_K$, is the effective dimension, derived from the decay rate of Kolmogorov $n$-widths associated with $K$ on $Ω$. Given a probability measure $μ$ on $Ω$, we analyze the relationship between these $n$-widths and eigenvalues of the integral operator $φ\\to \\int_ΩK(\\cdot,x)φ(x)dμ(x)$. We show that, for a fixed domain $Ω$, the Kolmogorov $n$-widths characterize the worst-case eigenvalue decay across all probability measures $μ$ supported on $Ω$. These eigenvalues are central to understanding the generalization behavior of constrained KRR, enabling us to derive an excess error bound of order $O(n^{-\\frac{2+d_K}{2+2d_K} + ε})$ for any $ε> 0$, when the training set size $n$ is large. We also propose an algorithm that estimates upper bounds on the $n$-widths using only a finite sample from $μ$. For distributions close to uniform, we prove that $ε$-accurate upper bounds on all $n$-widths can be computed with high probability using at most $O\\left(ε^{-d_ρ}\\log\\frac{1}ε\\right)$ samples, with fewer required for small $n$. Finally, we compute the effective dimension $d_K$ for various fractal sets and present additional numerical experiments. Our results show that, for kernels such as the Laplace kernel, the effective dimension $d_K$ can be significantly smaller than the Minkowski dimension $d_ρ$, even though $d_K = d_ρ$ provably holds on regular domains.",

    "abstract": "The Arabic language has undergone notable transformations over time, including the emergence of new vocabulary, the obsolescence of others, and shifts in word usage. This evolution is evident in the distinction between the classical and modern Arabic eras. Although historians and linguists have partitioned Arabic literature into multiple eras, relatively little research has explored the automatic classification of Arabic texts by time period, particularly beyond the domain of poetry. This paper addresses this gap by employing neural networks and deep learning techniques to automatically classify Arabic texts into distinct eras and periods. The proposed models are evaluated using two datasets derived from two publicly available corpora, covering texts from the pre-Islamic to the modern era. The study examines class setups ranging from binary to 15-class classification and considers both predefined historical eras and custom periodizations. Results range from F1-scores of 0.83 and 0.79 on the binary-era classification task using the OpenITI and APCD datasets, respectively, to 0.20 on the 15-era classification task using OpenITI and 0.18 on the 12-era classification task using APCD.",

This study presents a generalizable, systematic approach for evaluating prompts, demonstrated through an analysis of LLM-generated follow-up questions in a structured dialogue activity. Six prompt templates were designed and tested. The templates incorporated established prompt engineering patterns, with each prompt emphasizing distinct pedagogical strategies. The prompt templates were compared through a tournament-style evaluation framework that can be adapted for other educational applications. The tournament employed the Glicko2 rating system with eight judges evaluating question pairs across three dimensions: format, dialogue support, and appropriateness for learners. Data was sourced from 120 authentic user interactions across three distinct educational deployments. Results showed that a single prompt related to strategic reading out-performed other templates with win probabilities ranging from 81% to 100% in pairwise comparisons. This prompt combined persona and context manager pat-terns and was designed to support metacognitive learning strategies such as self-directed learning. The methodology showcases how educational technology re- searchers can systematically evaluate and improve prompt designs, moving beyond ad-hoc prompt engineering toward evidence-based prompt development for educational applications.",

Updating one or more supported languages with additional data or adding support for a new language involves retraining the model, which can be computationally inefficient and creates a severe maintenance bottleneck. Recent research on merging multilingual multitask models has shown promise in terms of improved quality, but its computational and maintenance efficiency remains unstudied. In this work, we provide the first focused analysis of this merging strategy from an efficiency perspective, evaluating it across three independent tasks. We demonstrate significant efficiency gains while maintaining parity in terms of quality: this merging approach reduces the initial training time by up to 50\\%. We also demonstrate that updating an individual language and re-merging as part of model maintenance reduces training costs by more than 60\\%, compared to re-training the full multilingual model. We show this on both public and proprietary industry datasets confirming that the approach works well for industrial use cases in addition to academic settings already studied in previous work.",

Current CIR benchmarks typically feature limited query categories and fail to capture the diverse requirements of real-world scenarios. To bridge this evaluation gap, we leverage image editing to achieve precise control over modification types and content, enabling a pipeline for synthesizing queries across a broad spectrum of categories. Using this pipeline, we construct EDIR, a novel fine-grained CIR benchmark. EDIR encompasses 5,000 high-quality queries structured across five main categories and fifteen subcategories. Our comprehensive evaluation of 13 multimodal embedding models reveals a significant capability gap; even state-of-the-art models (e.g., RzenEmbed and GME) struggle to perform consistently across all subcategories, highlighting the rigorous nature of our benchmark. Through comparative analysis, we further uncover inherent limitations in existing benchmarks, such as modality biases and insufficient categorical coverage. Furthermore, an in-domain training experiment demonstrates the feasibility of our benchmark. This experiment clarifies the task challenges by distinguishing between categories that are solvable with targeted data and those that expose intrinsic limitations of current model architectures.",

    "abstract": "Imbalanced classification, where one class is observed far less frequently than the other, often causes standard training procedures to prioritize the majority class and perform poorly on rare but important cases. A classic and widely used remedy is to augment the minority class with synthetic examples, but two basic questions remain under-resolved: when does synthetic augmentation actually help, and how many synthetic samples should be generated?   We develop a unified statistical framework for synthetic augmentation in imbalanced learning, studying models trained on imbalanced data augmented with synthetic minority samples and evaluated under the balanced population risk. Our theory shows that synthetic data is not always beneficial. In a ``local symmetry\" regime, imbalance is not the dominant source of error near the balanced optimum, so adding synthetic samples cannot improve learning rates and can even degrade performance by amplifying generator mismatch. When augmentation can help (a ``local asymmetry\" regime), the optimal synthetic size depends on generator accuracy and on whether the generator's residual mismatch is directionally aligned with the intrinsic majority-minority shift. This structure can make the best synthetic size deviate from naive full balancing, sometimes by a small refinement and sometimes substantially when generator bias is systematic. Practically, we recommend Validation-Tuned Synthetic Size (VTSS): select the synthetic size by minimizing balanced validation loss over a range centered near the fully balanced baseline, while allowing meaningful departures when the data indicate them. Simulations and a real sepsis prediction study support the theory and illustrate when synthetic augmentation helps, when it cannot, and how to tune its quantity effectively.",

    "abstract": "Executing Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic hardware poses the problem of mapping neurons to cores. SNNs operate by propagating spikes between neurons that form a graph through synapses. Neuromorphic hardware mimics them through a network-on-chip, transmitting spikes, and a mesh of cores, each managing several neurons. Its operational cost is tied to spike movement and active cores. A mapping comprises two tasks: partitioning the SNN's graph to fit inside cores and placement of each partition on the hardware mesh. Both are NP-hard problems, and as SNNs and hardware scale towards billions of neurons, they become increasingly difficult to tackle effectively. In this work, we propose to raise the abstraction of SNNs from graphs to hypergraphs, redesigning mapping techniques accordingly. The resulting model faithfully captures the replication of spikes inside cores by exposing the notion of hyperedge co-membership between neurons. We further show that the overlap and locality of hyperedges strongly correlate with high-quality mappings, making these properties instrumental in devising mapping algorithms. By exploiting them directly, grouping neurons through shared hyperedges, communication traffic and hardware resource usage can be reduced be yond what just contracting individual connections attains. To substantiate this insight, we consider several partitioning and placement algorithms, some newly devised, others adapted from literature, and compare them over progressively larger and bio-plausible SNNs. Our results show that hypergraph based techniques can achieve better mappings than the state-of-the-art at several execution time regimes. Based on these observations, we identify a promising selection of algorithms to achieve effective mappings at any scale.",

    "abstract": "Edge devices operate in constrained and varying resource settings, requiring dynamic architectures that can adapt to limitations of the available resources. To meet such demands, layer dropping ($\\mathcal{LD}$) approach is typically used to transform static models into dynamic ones by skipping parts of the network along with reducing overall computational complexity. However, existing $\\mathcal{LD}$ methods greatly impact the dynamic model's performance for low and high dropping cases, deteriorating the performance-computation trade-off. To this end, we propose a distillation-based layer dropping (DLD) framework that effectively combines the capabilities of knowledge distillation and $\\mathcal{LD}$ in an end-to-end fashion, thereby achieving state-of-the-art performance for dynamic speech networks. Comprehensive experimentation utilizing well-known speech recognition methods, including conformer and WavLM, on three public benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework, reducing the word error rate by $9.32\\%$ and $2.25\\%$ for high and no dropping cases with $33.3\\%$ reduction in training time.",

Languages such as Kashmiri, with approximately 7 million speakers and a complex Perso-Arabic script featuring unique diacritical marks, currently lack support in major OCR systems including Tesseract, TrOCR, and PaddleOCR. Manual dataset creation for such languages is prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone, often requiring word by word transcription of printed or handwritten text.   We present SynthOCR-Gen, an open-source synthetic OCR dataset generator specifically designed for low-resource languages.

We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating a 600,000-sample word-segmented Kashmiri OCR dataset, which we release publicly on HuggingFace.

To address the uncertainties of inaccurate dynamics modeling and sensor noise, we introduce a residual policy trained through RL with domain randomization. Crucially, we employ a model-based oracle policy, which has privileged access to ground-truth dynamics during training, to supervise the residual policy via a novel supervised loss. This supervision enables the policy to efficiently learn corrective behaviors that compensate for unmodeled effects without extensive reward shaping. Our method demonstrates improved robustness and generalization across a range of randomized conditions, offering a scalable solution for sim-to-real transfer in bipedal locomotion.",

This limits their ability to reason about recent events or updates. The main goal of this paper is to overcome that limitation by combining VLMs with external knowledge. By retrieving up-to-date information such as reverse image results, online fact-checks, and trusted expert content, the system can better assess whether an image and its claim are accurate, misleading, false, or unverifiable.

    "abstract": "Although Mamba models greatly improve Hyperspectral Image (HSI) classification, they have critical challenges in terms defining efficient and adaptive token sequences for improve performance. This paper therefore presents CSSMamba (Clustering-guided Spatial-Spectral Mamba) framework to better address the challenges, with the following contributions. First, to achieve efficient and adaptive token sequences for improved Mamba performance, we integrate the clustering mechanism into a spatial Mamba architecture, leading to a cluster-guided spatial Mamba module (CSpaMamba) that reduces the Mamba sequence length and improves Mamba feature learning capability. Second, to improve the learning of both spatial and spectral information, we integrate the CSpaMamba module with a spectral mamba module (SpeMamba), leading to a complete clustering-guided spatial-spectral Mamba framework. Third, to further improve feature learning capability, we introduce an Attention-Driven Token Selection mechanism to optimize Mamba token sequencing. Last, to seamlessly integrate clustering into the Mamba model in a coherent manner, we design a Learnable Clustering Module that learns the cluster memberships in an adaptive manner. Experiments on the Pavia University, Indian Pines, and Liao-Ning 01 datasets demonstrate that CSSMamba achieves higher accuracy and better boundary preservation compared to state-of-the-art CNN, Transformer, and Mamba-based methods.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models enable users to access database using natural language interfaces using tools like Text2SQL, Text2SPARQL, and Text2Cypher, which translate user questions into structured database queries. While these systems improve database accessibility, most research focuses on English with limited multilingual support. This work investigates a scalable multilingual Text2Cypher, aiming to support new languages without re-running full fine-tuning, avoiding manual hyper-parameter tuning, and maintaining performance close to joint multilingual fine-tuning. We train language-specific LoRA adapters for English, Spanish, and Turkish and combined them via uniform linear merging or learned fusion MLP with dynamic gating. Experimental results show that the fusion MLP recovers around 75\\% of the accuracy gains from joint multilingual fine-tuning while requiring only a smaller subset of the data, outperforming linear merging across all three languages. This approach enables incremental language expansion to new languages by requiring only one LoRA adapter and a lightweight MLP retraining. Learned adapter fusion offers a practical alternative to expensive joint fine-tuning, balancing performance, data efficiency, and scalability for multilingual Text2Cypher task.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Neural Particle Automata (NPA), a Lagrangian generalization of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) from static lattices to dynamic particle systems. Unlike classical Eulerian NCA where cells are pinned to pixels or voxels, NPA model each cell as a particle with a continuous position and internal state, both updated by a shared, learnable neural rule. This particle-based formulation yields clear individuation of cells, allows heterogeneous dynamics, and concentrates computation only on regions where activity is present. At the same time, particle systems pose challenges: neighborhoods are dynamic, and a naive implementation of local interactions scale quadratically with the number of particles. We address these challenges by replacing grid-based neighborhood perception with differentiable Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) operators backed by memory-efficient, CUDA-accelerated kernels, enabling scalable end-to-end training. Across tasks including morphogenesis, point-cloud classification, and particle-based texture synthesis, we show that NPA retain key NCA behaviors such as robustness and self-regeneration, while enabling new behaviors specific to particle systems. Together, these results position NPA as a compact neural model for learning self-organizing particle dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Pixel-wise capabilities are essential for building interactive intelligent systems. However, pixel-wise multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remain difficult to scale due to complex region-level encoders, specialized segmentation decoders, and incompatible training objectives. To address these challenges, we present SAMTok, a discrete mask tokenizer that converts any region mask into two special tokens and reconstructs the mask using these tokens with high fidelity. By treating masks as new language tokens, SAMTok enables base MLLMs (such as the QwenVL series) to learn pixel-wise capabilities through standard next-token prediction and simple reinforcement learning, without architectural modifications and specialized loss design. SAMTok builds on SAM2 and is trained on 209M diverse masks using a mask encoder and residual vector quantizer to produce discrete, compact, and information-rich tokens. With 5M SAMTok-formatted mask understanding and generation data samples, QwenVL-SAMTok attains state-of-the-art or comparable results on region captioning, region VQA, grounded conversation, referring segmentation, scene graph parsing, and multi-round interactive segmentation. We further introduce a textual answer-matching reward that enables efficient reinforcement learning for mask generation, delivering substantial improvements on GRES and GCG benchmarks. Our results demonstrate a scalable and straightforward paradigm for equipping MLLMs with strong pixel-wise capabilities. Our code and models are available.",

    "abstract": "Clustering is a fundamental problem, aiming to partition a set of elements, like agents or data points, into clusters such that elements in the same cluster are closer to each other than to those in other clusters. In this paper, we present a new framework for studying online non-centroid clustering with delays, where elements, that arrive one at a time as points in a finite metric space, should be assigned to clusters, but assignments need not be immediate. Specifically, upon arrival, each point's location is revealed, and an online algorithm has to irrevocably assign it to an existing cluster or create a new one containing, at this moment, only this point. However, we allow decisions to be postponed at a delay cost, instead of following the more common assumption of immediate decisions upon arrival. This poses a critical challenge: the goal is to minimize both the total distance costs between points in each cluster and the overall delay costs incurred by postponing assignments. In the classic worst-case arrival model, where points arrive in an arbitrary order, no algorithm has a competitive ratio better than sublogarithmic in the number of points. To overcome this strong impossibility, we focus on a stochastic arrival model, where points' locations are drawn independently across time from an unknown and fixed probability distribution over the finite metric space. We offer hope for beyond worst-case adversaries: we devise an algorithm that is constant competitive in the sense that, as the number of points grows, the ratio between the expected overall costs of the output clustering and an optimal offline clustering is bounded by a constant.",

    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) agents often exhibit abrupt shifts in tone and persona during extended interaction, reflecting the absence of explicit temporal structure governing agent-level state. While prior work emphasizes turn-local sentiment or static emotion classification, the role of explicit affective dynamics in shaping long-horizon agent behavior remains underexplored. This work investigates whether imposing dynamical structure on an external affective state can induce temporal coherence and controlled recovery in multi-turn dialogue. We introduce an agent-level affective subsystem that maintains a continuous Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) state external to the language model and governed by first- and second-order update rules. Instantaneous affective signals are extracted using a fixed, memoryless estimator and integrated over time via exponential smoothing or momentum-based dynamics. The resulting affective state is injected back into generation without modifying model parameters. Using a fixed 25-turn dialogue protocol, we compare stateless, first-order, and second-order affective dynamics. Stateless agents fail to exhibit coherent trajectories or recovery, while state persistence enables delayed responses and reliable recovery. Second-order dynamics introduce affective inertia and hysteresis that increase with momentum, revealing a trade-off between stability and responsiveness.",

As practitioners do not approach PbD systematically, we suggest that RE methods for PbD should be assessed against organisational goals, rather than process characteristics only.

    "abstract": "Human motion reconstruction from monocular videos is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with broad applications in AR/VR, robotics, and digital content creation, but remains challenging under frequent occlusions in real-world settings.Existing regression-based methods are efficient but fragile to missing observations, while optimization- and diffusion-based approaches improve robustness at the cost of slow inference speed and heavy preprocessing steps. To address these limitations, we leverage recent advances in generative masked modeling and present MoRo: Masked Modeling for human motion Recovery under Occlusions. MoRo is an occlusion-robust, end-to-end generative framework that formulates motion reconstruction as a video-conditioned task, and efficiently recover human motion in a consistent global coordinate system from RGB videos. By masked modeling, MoRo naturally handles occlusions while enabling efficient, end-to-end inference. To overcome the scarcity of paired video-motion data, we design a cross-modality learning scheme that learns multi-modal priors from a set of heterogeneous datasets: (i) a trajectory-aware motion prior trained on MoCap datasets, (ii) an image-conditioned pose prior trained on image-pose datasets, capturing diverse per-frame poses, and (iii) a video-conditioned masked transformer that fuses motion and pose priors, finetuned on video-motion datasets to integrate visual cues with motion dynamics for robust inference. Extensive experiments on EgoBody and RICH demonstrate that MoRo substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and motion realism under occlusions, while performing on-par in non-occluded scenarios. MoRo achieves real-time inference at 70 FPS on a single H200 GPU.",

This gives the first example of a rich and natural class of functions which may depend on a super-constant number of variables and yet is efficiently testable in the relative-error model with constant query complexity.   A crucial new ingredient enabling our approach is a novel decomposition of any $s$-term DNF formula into ``local clusters'' of terms.

We propose DSFedMed, a dual-scale federated framework that enables mutual knowledge distillation between a centralized foundation model and lightweight client models for medical image segmentation. To support knowledge distillation, a set of high-quality medical images is generated to replace real public datasets, and a learnability-guided sample selection strategy is proposed to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in dual-scale distillation. This mutual distillation enables the foundation model to transfer general knowledge to lightweight clients, while also incorporating client-specific insights to refine the foundation model. Evaluations on five medical imaging segmentation datasets show that DSFedMed achieves an average 2 percent improvement in Dice score while reducing communication costs and inference time by nearly 90 percent compared to existing federated foundation model baselines. These results demonstrate significant efficiency gains and scalability for resource-limited federated deployments.",

Our analysis departs from prior work by fully leveraging the firm non-expansiveness of convex projectors, a proof strategy not previously applied in this setting. For convex losses, CLASP achieves regret $O\\left(T^{\\max\\{β,1-β\\}}\\right)$ and cumulative squared penalty $O\\left(T^{1-β}\\right)$ for any $β\\in (0,1)$. Most importantly, for strongly convex problems, CLASP provides the first logarithmic guarantees on both regret and cumulative squared penalty.

Despite such interpolation, they often exhibit strong generalization performance on unseen data, a phenomenon that has motivated extensive theoretical investigations. Comforting results show that interpolation indeed may not affect the minimax rate of convergence under the squared error loss. In the mean time, DNNs are well known to be highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations in future inputs. A natural question then arises: Can interpolation also escape from suboptimal performance under a future $X$-attack? In this paper, we investigate the adversarial robustness of interpolating estimators in a framework of nonparametric regression. A finding is that interpolating estimators must be suboptimal even under a subtle future $X$-attack, and achieving perfect fitting can substantially damage their robustness. An interesting phenomenon in the high interpolation regime, which we term the curse of simple size, is also revealed and discussed. Numerical experiments support our theoretical findings.",

However, by default, VLA models may overly attend to image tokens in the task-irrelevant region, which we describe as 'distracting tokens'. This behavior can disturb the model from the generation of the desired action tokens in each step, affecting the success rate of tasks. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective plug-and-play Distracting Token Pruning (DTP) framework, which dynamically detects and prunes these distracting image tokens. By correcting the model's visual attention patterns, we aim to improve the task success rate, as well as exploring the performance upper boundaries of the model without altering its original architecture or adding additional inputs. Experiments on the SIMPLER Benchmark (Li et al., 2024) show that our method consistently achieving relative improvements in task success rates across different types of novel VLA models, demonstrating generalizability to transformer-based VLAs. Further analysis reveals a negative correlation between the task success rate and the amount of attentions in the task-irrelevant region for all models tested, highlighting a common phenomenon of VLA models that could guide future research.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has substantially advanced medical image segmentation, yet achieving robust generalization across diverse imaging modalities and anatomical structures remains a major challenge. A key contributor to this limitation lies in how existing architectures, ranging from CNNs to Transformers and their hybrids, primarily encode spatial information while overlooking frequency-domain representations that capture rich structural and textural cues. Although few recent studies have begun exploring spectral information at the feature level, supervision-level integration of frequency cues-crucial for fine-grained object localization-remains largely untapped. To this end, we propose Phi-SegNet, a CNN-based architecture that incorporates phase-aware information at both architectural and optimization levels. The network integrates Bi-Feature Mask Former (BFMF) modules that blend neighboring encoder features to reduce semantic gaps, and Reverse Fourier Attention (RFA) blocks that refine decoder outputs using phase-regularized features. A dedicated phase-aware loss aligns these features with structural priors, forming a closed feedback loop that emphasizes boundary precision. Evaluated on five public datasets spanning X-ray, US, histopathology, MRI, and colonoscopy, Phi-SegNet consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, with an average relative improvement of 1.54+/-1.26% in IoU and 0.98+/-0.71% in F1-score over the next best-performing model. In cross-dataset generalization scenarios involving unseen datasets from the known domain, Phi-SegNet also exhibits robust and superior performance, highlighting its adaptability and modality-agnostic design. These findings demonstrate the potential of leveraging spectral priors in both feature representation and supervision, paving the way for generalized segmentation frameworks that excel in fine-grained object localization.",

    "title": "Improve the autonomy of the SE2(3) group based Extended Kalman Filter for Integrated Navigation: Theoretical Analysis",
    "abstract": "One of core advantages of the SE2(3) Lie group framework for navigation modeling lies in the autonomy of error propagation. Current research on Lie group based extended Kalman filters has demonstrated that error propagation autonomy holds in low-precision applications, such as in micro electromechanical system (MEMS) based integrated navigation without considering earth rotation and inertial device biases. However, in high-precision navigation state estimation, maintaining autonomy is extremely difficult when considering with earth rotation and inertial device biases. This paper presents the theoretical analysis on the autonomy of SE2(3) group based high-precision navigation models under inertial, earth and world frame respectively. Through theoretical analysis, we find that the limitation of the traditional, trivial SE2(3) group navigation modeling method is that the presence of Coriolis force terms introduced by velocity in non-inertial frame. Therefore, a construction method for SE2(3) group navigation models is proposed, which brings the navigation models closer to full autonomy.",

    "abstract": "Widely adopted medical image segmentation methods, although efficient, are primarily deterministic and remain poorly amenable to natural language prompts. Thus, they lack the capability to estimate multiple proposals, human interaction, and cross-modality adaptation. Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have shown potential to bridge the gap. However, training them from scratch requires a large dataset-a limitation for medical image segmentation. Furthermore, they are often limited to binary segmentation and cannot be conditioned on a natural language prompt. To this end, we propose a novel framework called ProGiDiff that leverages existing image generation models for medical image segmentation purposes. Specifically, we propose a ControlNet-style conditioning mechanism with a custom encoder, suitable for image conditioning, to steer a pre-trained diffusion model to output segmentation masks. It naturally extends to a multi-class setting simply by prompting the target organ. Our experiment on organ segmentation from CT images demonstrates strong performance compared to previous methods and could greatly benefit from an expert-in-the-loop setting to leverage multiple proposals. Importantly, we demonstrate that the learned conditioning mechanism can be easily transferred through low-rank, few-shot adaptation to segment MR images.",

    "abstract": "Designing faster algorithms for solving Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems is highly desired across numerous practical domains, as a vast array of complex real-world challenges can be effectively modeled as MILP formulations. Solving these problems typically employs the branch-and-bound algorithm, the core of which can be conceived as searching for a path of nodes (or sub-problems) that contains the optimal solution to the original MILP problem. Traditional approaches to finding this path rely heavily on hand-crafted, intuition-based heuristic strategies, which often suffer from unstable and unpredictable performance across different MILP problem instances. To address this limitation, we introduce DeepBound, a deep learning-based node selection algorithm that automates the learning of such human intuition from data. The core of DeepBound lies in learning to prioritize nodes containing the optimal solution, thereby improving solving efficiency. DeepBound introduces a multi-level feature fusion network to capture the node representations. To tackle the inherent node imbalance in branch-and-bound trees, DeepBound employs a pairwise training paradigm that enhances the model's ability to discriminate between nodes. Extensive experiments on three NP-hard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that DeepBound achieves superior solving efficiency over conventional heuristic rules and existing learning-based approaches, obtaining optimal feasible solutions with significantly reduced computation time. Moreover, DeepBound demonstrates strong generalization capability on large and complex instances. The analysis of its learned features reveals that the method can automatically discover more flexible and robust feature selection, which may effectively improve and potentially replace human-designed heuristic rules.",

    "abstract": "How do individuals recover from cybercrimes? Victims experience various types of harm after cybercrimes, including monetary loss, data breaches, negative emotions, and even psychological trauma. The aspects that support their recovery process and contribute to individual cyber resilience remain underinvestigated. To address this gap, we interviewed 18 cybercrime victims from Western Europe using a trauma-informed approach. We identified four common stages following victimization: recognition, coping, processing, and recovery. Participants adopted various strategies to mitigate the impact of cybercrime and used different indicators to describe recovery. While they mostly relied on social support and self-regulation for emotional coping, service providers largely determined whether victims were able to recover their money. Internal factors, external support, and context sensitivity collectively contribute to individuals' cyber resilience. We recommend trauma-informed support for cybercrime victims. Extending our conceptualization of individual cyber resilience, we propose collaborative and context-sensitive strategies to address the harmful impacts of cybercrime.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of crop above-ground biomass (AGB) under water stress is critical for monitoring crop productivity, guiding irrigation, and supporting climate-resilient agriculture. Data-driven models scale well but often lack interpretability and degrade under distribution shift, whereas process-based crop models (e.g. DSSAT, APSIM, LINTUL5) require extensive calibration and are difficult to deploy over large spatial domains. To address these limitations, we propose AgriPINN, a process-informed neural network that integrates a biophysical crop-growth differential equation as a differentiable constraint within a deep learning backbone. This design encourages physiologically consistent biomass dynamics under water-stress conditions while preserving model scalability for spatially distributed AGB prediction. AgriPINN recovers latent physiological variables, including leaf area index (LAI), absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), radiation use efficiency (RUE), and water-stress factors, without requiring direct supervision. We pretrain AgriPINN on 60 years of historical data across 397 regions in Germany and fine-tune it on three years of field experiments under controlled water treatments. Results show that AgriPINN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep-learning baselines (ConvLSTM-ViT, SLTF, CNN-Transformer) and the process-based LINTUL5 model in terms of accuracy (RMSE reductions up to $43\\%$) and computational efficiency. By combining the scalability of deep learning with the biophysical rigor of process-based modeling, AgriPINN provides a robust and interpretable framework for spatio-temporal AGB prediction, offering practical value for planning of irrigation infrastructure, yield forecasting, and climate-adaptation planning.",

    "abstract": "In constrained stochastic optimization, one naturally expects that imposing a stricter feasible set does not increase the statistical risk of an estimator defined by projection onto that set. In this paper, we show that this intuition can fail even in canonical settings.   We study the Gaussian sequence model, a deliberately austere test best, where for a compact, convex set $Θ\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ one observes \\[ Y = θ^\\star + σZ, \\qquad Z \\sim N(0, I_d), \\] and seeks to estimate an unknown parameter $θ^\\star \\in Θ$. The natural estimator is the least squares estimator (LSE), which coincides with the Euclidean projection of $Y$ onto $Θ$. We construct an explicit example exhibiting \\emph{risk reversal}: for sufficiently large noise, there exist nested compact convex sets $Θ_S \\subset Θ_L$ and a parameter $θ^\\star \\in Θ_S$ such that the LSE constrained to $Θ_S$ has strictly larger risk than the LSE constrained to $Θ_L$. We further show that this phenomenon can persist at the level of worst-case risk, with the supremum risk over the smaller constraint set exceeding that over the larger one.   We clarify this behavior by contrasting noise regimes. In the vanishing-noise limit, the risk admits a first-order expansion governed by the statistical dimension of the tangent cone at $θ^\\star$, and tighter constraints uniformly reduce risk. In contrast, in the diverging-noise regime, the risk is determined by global geometric interactions between the constraint set and random noise directions. Here, the embedding of $Θ_S$ within $Θ_L$ can reverse the risk ordering.   These results reveal a previously unrecognized failure mode of projection-based estimators: in sufficiently noisy settings, tightening a constraint can paradoxically degrade statistical performance.",

Yet, testing interventions to encourage prosocial dispositions, such as open-mindedness, has been hindered by researchers' limited ability to manipulate platform features and isolate causal effects in commercial environments. We address this challenge through a randomized controlled trial with 2,282 U.S. adults conducted on a new research platform we developed that uses AI bots to replicate live social media dynamics while enabling controlled experimentation. Participants engaged in 15-minute discussions about energy and climate topics, with treatment groups exposed to curiosity priming either through modified on-platform social norms, interface affordances, or both. Results demonstrate that curiosity priming significantly increased question-asking behavior and textual measures of curiosity in user posts, while also reducing toxicity. Although interventions decreased generic engagement behaviors like liking and commenting, they had no significant negative impact on reported app enjoyment or time spent writing posts and replies. Leveraging experimental control over platform features, our findings suggest that platform designs prioritizing curiosity can promote prosocial behaviors among users without compromising user experience.",

    "abstract": "A class of structures is monadically dependent if one cannot interpret all graphs in colored expansions from the class using a fixed first-order formula. A tree-ordered $σ$-structure is the expansion of a $σ$-structure with a tree-order. A tree-ordered $σ$-structure is weakly sparse if the Gaifman graph of its $σ$-reduct excludes some biclique (of a given fixed size) as a subgraph. Tree-ordered weakly sparse graphs are commonly used as tree-models (for example for classes with bounded shrubdepth, structurally bounded expansion, bounded cliquewidth, or bounded twin-width), motivating their study on their own. In this paper, we consider several constructions on tree-ordered structures, such as tree-ordered variants of the Gaifman graph and of the incidence graph, induced and non-induced tree-ordered minors, and generalized fundamental graphs.   We provide characterizations of monadically dependent classes of tree-ordered weakly sparse $σ$-structures based on each of these constructions, some of them establishing unexpected bridges with sparsity theory. As an application, we prove that a class of tree-ordered weakly sparse structures is monadically dependent if and only if its sparsification is nowhere-dense. Moreover, the sparsification transduction translates boundedness of clique-width and linear clique-width into boundedness of tree-width and path-width. We also prove that first-order model checking is not fixed parameter tractable on independent hereditary classes of tree-ordered weakly sparse graphs (assuming $AW[*]\\neq FPT$) and give what we believe is the first model-theoretical characterization of classes of graphs excluding a minor, thus opening a new perspective of structural graph theory.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of collision-free humanoid traversal in cluttered indoor scenes, such as hurdling over objects scattered on the floor, crouching under low-hanging obstacles, or squeezing through narrow passages. To achieve this goal, the humanoid needs to map its perception of surrounding obstacles with diverse spatial layouts and geometries to the corresponding traversal skills. However, the lack of an effective representation that captures humanoid-obstacle relationships during collision avoidance makes directly learning such mappings difficult. We therefore propose Humanoid Potential Field (HumanoidPF), which encodes these relationships as collision-free motion directions, significantly facilitating RL-based traversal skill learning. We also find that HumanoidPF exhibits a surprisingly negligible sim-to-real gap as a perceptual representation. To further enable generalizable traversal skills through diverse and challenging cluttered indoor scenes, we further propose a hybrid scene generation method, incorporating crops of realistic 3D indoor scenes and procedurally synthesized obstacles. We successfully transfer our policy to the real world and develop a teleoperation system where users could command the humanoid to traverse in cluttered indoor scenes with just a single click. Extensive experiments are conducted in both simulation and the real world to validate the effectiveness of our method. Demos and code can be found in our website: https://axian12138.github.io/CAT/.",

To test this, we introduce Trajectory Replay via Concept-Basis Reconstruction, a framework that transfers refusal interventions from donor to target models, spanning diverse architectures (e.g., Dense to MoE) and training regimes, without using target-side refusal supervision. By aligning layers via concept fingerprints and reconstructing refusal directions using a shared ``recipe'' of concept atoms, we map the donor's ablation trajectory into the target's semantic space. To preserve capabilities, we introduce a weight-SVD stability guard that projects interventions away from high-variance weight subspaces to prevent collateral damage. Our evaluation across 8 model pairs (including GPT-OSS-20B and GLM-4) confirms that these transferred recipes consistently attenuate refusal while maintaining performance, providing strong evidence for the semantic universality of safety alignment.",

This network employs RISs to reflect ISAC signals into low-altitude space for sensing. To enhance signal strength, we employ active RIS (ARIS) to amplify the signals. Moreover, in order to avoid error propagation and data association in traditional sensing methods, we model low-altitude surveillance as an imaging problem based on compressed sensing theory, which can be solved through the subspace pursuit algorithm. We derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the proposed RIS-aided low-altitude imaging system and analyze the impacts of various system parameters on sensing performance, providing guidance for ISAC system configuration.

    "abstract": "Neural networks possess incredible capabilities for extracting abstract features from data. Electromagnetic computing harnesses wave propagation to execute computational operations. Metasurfaces, composed of subwavelength meta-atoms, are capable of engineering electromagnetic waves in unprecedented ways. What happens when combining these three cutting-edge technologies? This question has sparked a surge of interest in designing physical neural networks using stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) technology, with the aim of implementing various computational tasks by directly processing electromagnetic waves. SIMs open up an exciting avenue toward high-speed, massively parallel, and low-power signal processing in the electromagnetic domain. This article provides a comprehensive overview of SIM technology, commencing with its evolutionary development. We subsequently examine its theoretical foundations and existing SIM prototypes in depth. Furthermore, the optimization/training strategies conceived to configure SIMs for achieving the desired functionalities are discussed from two different perspectives. Additionally, we explore the diverse applications of SIM technology across the communication, sensing, and computing domains, presenting experimental evidence that highlights its distinctive advantages in supporting multiple functions within a single device. Finally, we identify critical technical challenges that must be addressed to deploy SIMs in next-generation wireless networks and shed light on promising research directions to unlock their full potential.",

    "title": "Data-Driven Conditional Flexibility Index",
    "abstract": "With the increasing flexibilization of processes, determining robust scheduling decisions has become an important goal. Traditionally, the flexibility index has been used to identify safe operating schedules by approximating the admissible uncertainty region using simple admissible uncertainty sets, such as hypercubes. Presently, available contextual information, such as forecasts, has not been considered to define the admissible uncertainty set when determining the flexibility index. We propose the conditional flexibility index (CFI), which extends the traditional flexibility index in two ways: by learning the parametrized admissible uncertainty set from historical data and by using contextual information to make the admissible uncertainty set conditional. This is achieved using a normalizing flow that learns a bijective mapping from a Gaussian base distribution to the data distribution. The admissible latent uncertainty set is constructed as a hypersphere in the latent space and mapped to the data space. By incorporating contextual information, the CFI provides a more informative estimate of flexibility by defining admissible uncertainty sets in regions that are more likely to be relevant under given conditions. Using an illustrative example, we show that no general statement can be made about data-driven admissible uncertainty sets outperforming simple sets, or conditional sets outperforming unconditional ones. However, both data-driven and conditional admissible uncertainty sets ensure that only regions of the uncertain parameter space containing realizations are considered. We apply the CFI to a security-constrained unit commitment example and demonstrate that the CFI can improve scheduling quality by incorporating temporal information.",

    "abstract": "The rise of live streaming has transformed online interaction, enabling massive real-time engagement but also exposing platforms to complex risks such as scams and coordinated malicious behaviors. Detecting these risks is challenging because harmful actions often accumulate gradually and recur across seemingly unrelated streams. To address this, we propose CS-VAR (Cross-Session Evidence-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Detector) for live streaming risk assessment. In CS-VAR, a lightweight, domain-specific model performs fast session-level risk inference, guided during training by a Large Language Model (LLM) that reasons over retrieved cross-session behavioral evidence and transfers its local-to-global insights to the small model. This design enables the small model to recognize recurring patterns across streams, perform structured risk assessment, and maintain efficiency for real-time deployment. Extensive offline experiments on large-scale industrial datasets, combined with online validation, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CS-VAR. Furthermore, CS-VAR provides interpretable, localized signals that effectively empower real-world moderation for live streaming.",

    "abstract": "Functional dependencies (FDs) are fundamental integrity constraints in relational databases, but discovering them under incremental updates remains challenging. While static algorithms are inefficient due to full re-execution, incremental algorithms suffer from severe performance and memory bottlenecks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes EAIFD, a novel algorithm for incremental FD discovery. EAIFD maintains the partial hypergraph of difference sets and reframes the incremental FD discovery problem into minimal hitting set enumeration on hypergraph, avoiding full re-runs. EAIFD introduces two key innovations. First, a multi-attribute hash table ($MHT$) is devised for high-frequency key-value mappings of valid FDs, whose memory consumption is proven to be independent of the dataset size. Second, two-step validation strategy is developed to efficiently validate the enumerated candidates, which leverages $MHT$ to effectively reduce the validation space and then selectively loads data blocks for batch validation of remaining candidates, effectively avoiding repeated I/O operations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the significant advantages of EAIFD. Compared to existing algorithms, EAIFD achieves up to an order-of-magnitude speedup in runtime while reducing memory usage by over two orders-of-magnitude, establishing it as a highly efficient and scalable solution for incremental FD discovery.",

    "abstract": "Virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) aims to computationally synthesize molecular staining patterns from routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\\&E) images, offering a cost-effective and tissue-efficient alternative to traditional physical staining. However, this task is particularly challenging: H\\&E morphology provides ambiguous cues about protein expression, and similar tissue structures may correspond to distinct molecular states. Most existing methods focus on direct appearance synthesis to implicitly achieve cross-modal generation, often resulting in semantic inconsistencies due to insufficient structural priors. In this paper, we propose Pathology-Aware Integrated Next-Scale Transformation (PAINT), a visual autoregressive framework that reformulates the synthesis process as a structure-first conditional generation task. Unlike direct image translation, PAINT enforces a causal order by resolving molecular details conditioned on a global structural layout. Central to this approach is the introduction of a Spatial Structural Start Map (3S-Map), which grounds the autoregressive initialization in observed morphology, ensuring deterministic, spatially aligned synthesis. Experiments on the IHC4BC and MIST datasets demonstrate that PAINT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in structural fidelity and clinical downstream tasks, validating the potential of structure-guided autoregressive modeling.",

    "abstract": "Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST) has gained increasing attention for its ability to translate speech from one language to another, while reducing error propagation and latency inherent in traditional cascaded pipelines. However, existing direct S2ST systems continue to face notable challenges, including instability in semantic-acoustic alignment when parallel speech data is scarce, difficulty in preserving speaker identity, and limited multilingual scalability. In this work, we introduce DS2ST-LM, a scalable, single-stage direct S2ST framework leveraging a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM). The architecture integrates a Whisper speech encoder, a learnable projection module, a Qwen2-0.5B LLM, and a timbre-controlled vocoder. We construct GigaS2S-1000, a 1000-hour bilingual corpus by extending the GigaST dataset with high-fidelity synthetic target speech, and show that this synthetic data alleviates data scarcity to some extent. We investigate two semantic token generation strategies: speech-derived S3 tokens and text-derived tokens generated by a pre-trained LLM, and analyze their impact on training stability and semantic consistency. We further evaluate three projection architectures (Linear, Conv1D-Linear, and Q-Former) and observe that while higher-capacity projectors converge faster, the simple Linear projector achieves higher performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DS2ST-LM outperforms traditional cascaded and ST (Qwen-Audio) + TTS baselines across both lexical (BLEU, METEOR) and semantic (BLEURT, COMET) metrics, while extending to multiple language pairs, including French, Spanish, German, Hindi, Bengali, and Urdu. Furthermore, we incorporate timbre-aware speech synthesis to preserve speaker information, enabling DS2ST-LM to surpass prior direct S2ST systems in both speaker similarity and perceptual naturalness.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of visual foundation models has revolutionized visual odometry~(VO) and SLAM, enabling pose estimation and dense reconstruction within a single feed-forward network. However, unlike traditional pipelines that leverage keyframe methods to enhance efficiency and accuracy, current foundation model based methods, such as VGGT-Long, typically process raw image sequences indiscriminately. This leads to computational redundancy and degraded performance caused by low inter-frame parallax, which provides limited contextual stereo information. Integrating traditional geometric heuristics into these methods is non-trivial, as their performance depends on high-dimensional latent representations rather than explicit geometric metrics. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel keyframe-based feed-forward VO. Instead of relying on hand-crafted rules, our approach employs reinforcement learning to derive an adaptive keyframe policy in a data-driven manner, aligning selection with the intrinsic characteristics of the underlying foundation model. We train our agent on TartanAir dataset and conduct extensive evaluations across several real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent and substantial improvements over state-of-the-art feed-forward VO methods.",

We make two contributions: (1)Encoder Model Pre-trained from Scratch: ModernBERT-based bidirectional encoders pre-trained on a Turkish-dominant corpus of 112.7 billion tokens. We implement a checkpoint selection strategy that evaluates downstream retrieval performance throughout training, revealing that optimal checkpoints achieve best retrieval scores before pre-training loss reaches its minimum. Our encoder models achieve top-3 rankings on the Turkish retrieval leaderboard, with smaller models (155M parameters) achieving comparable performance to larger reference models (307M-567M parameters). Our approach achieves 92.36% production efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models (embeddinggemma-300m: 100.00%, BAAI/bge-m3: 99.54%, newmindai/bge-m3-stsb: 94.38%), ranking fourth overall despite requiring less computational resources. SOTA models rely on multi-stage, computationally intensive training pipelines, making our single-stage pre-training followed by efficient post-training approach a cost-effective alternative; (2)Decoder Model with Continual Pre-training (CPT): Qwen3-1.7B and Qwen3-4B models adapted to Turkish legal domain through controlled curriculum learning. Four-phase CPT with optimal sample ratios enables gradual transition from general language knowledge to specialized legal terminology and long-context reasoning. This approach achieves 36.2% perplexity reduction on Turkish legal text, demonstrating domain adaptation gains.",

THOR is the first architecture to unify data from Copernicus Sentinel-1, -2, and -3 (OLCI & SLSTR) satellites, processing their native 10 m to 1000 m resolutions in a single model. We pre-train THOR with a novel randomized patch and input image size strategy. This allows a single set of pre-trained weights to be deployed at inference with any patch size, enabling a dynamic trade-off between computational cost and feature resolution without retraining. We pre-train THOR on THOR Pretrain, a new, large-scale multi-sensor dataset and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on downstream benchmarks, particularly in data-limited regimes like the PANGAEA 10% split, validating that THOR's flexible feature generation excels for diverse climate and society applications.",

    "abstract": "The representation of requirements plays a critical role in the accuracy of requirements inspection. While visual representations, such as UML diagrams, are widely used alongside text-based requirements, their effectiveness in supporting inspection is still debated. Cognitive abilities, such as working memory and mental rotation skills, may also influence inspection accuracy. This study aims to evaluate whether the use of UML sequence diagrams alongside text-based requirements improves the accuracy of requirements inspection compared to text-based requirements alone and to explore whether cognitive abilities are associated with differences in performance across the two treatments (text vs text with UML support). We conducted a crossover experiment with 38 participants to assess the accuracy of requirements inspection under the two treatments in terms of issues found and justifications provided. Linear mixed-effects and generalized linear models were used to analyse the effects of treatment, period, sequence, and cognitive abilities. The results indicate a significant three-way interaction between representation type, working memory capacity, and mental rotation ability. This finding suggests that the effectiveness of UML support is not uniform across individuals: participants with high scores in both cognitive abilities experienced reduced performance when using UML for violation detection. Conversely, the same cognitive profile was associated with improved justification accuracy under UML-aided inspection, indicating that higher cognitive abilities may support deeper reasoning processes when dealing with multi-modal information, i.e., diagrams and text.",

    "abstract": "Modern programming languages, most notably Rust, offer advanced linguistic constructs for building highly configurable software systems as aggregation of features -- identified by a configuration. However, they pose substantial challenges for program analysis, optimization, and testing, as the combinatorial explosion of configurations often makes exhaustive exploration infeasible. In this manuscript, we present the first compiler-based method for prioritizing configurations. Our approach consists of four main steps: 1. extracting a tailored intermediate representation from the Rust compiler, 2. constructing two complementary graph-based data structures, 3. using centrality measures to rank features, and 4. refining the ranking by considering the extent of code they impact. A fixed number of most relevant configurations are generated based on the achieved feature ranking. The validity of the generated configurations is guaranteed by using a SAT solver that takes a representation of this graph in conjunctive normal form. We formalized this approach and implemented it in a prototype, RustyEx, by instrumenting the Rust compiler. An empirical evaluation on higher-ranked open source Rust projects shows that RustyEx efficiently generates user-specified sets of configurations within bounded resources, while ensuring soundness by construction. The results demonstrate that centrality-guided configuration prioritization enables effective and practical exploration of large configuration spaces, paving the way for future research in configuration-aware analysis and optimization.",

Existing benchmarks attempting to measure this matter rely on synthetic, Visual Question Answer templates or focus on perceptual video quality that is tangential to measuring how well the video abides by physical laws. To address this fragmentation, we introduce PhysicsMind, a unified benchmark with both real and simulation environments that evaluates law-consistent reasoning and generation over three canonical principles: Center of Mass, Lever Equilibrium, and Newton's First Law. PhysicsMind comprises two main tasks: i) VQA tasks, testing whether models can reason and determine physical quantities and values from images or short videos, and ii) Video Generation(VG) tasks, evaluating if predicted motion trajectories obey the same center-of-mass, torque, and inertial constraints as the ground truth. A broad range of recent models and video generation models is evaluated on PhysicsMind and found to rely on appearance heuristics while often violating basic mechanics. These gaps indicate that current scaling and training are still insufficient for robust physical understanding, underscoring PhysicsMind as a focused testbed for physics-aware multimodal models.

We realize a five-qubit instance of the protocol as an inter-register message-transfer pattern within a single circuit, rather than physical signaling, and evaluate its behavior under realistic device noise and compilation constraints. The circuit encodes branch-conditioned evolution of an observer subsystem whose dynamics depend on a control qubit, followed by a controlled transfer operation that probes correlations between conditional measurement contexts.   Executing on the ibm_fez backend with 20000 shots, we observe population-based visibility of 0.877, coherence witnesses of 0.840 and -0.811 along orthogonal axes, and a phase-sensitive magnitude of approximately 1.17. While the visibility metric is insensitive to some classes of dephasing, the coherence witnesses provide complementary sensitivity to off-diagonal noise.   This work does not test or discriminate among interpretations of quantum mechanics. Instead, it provides a reproducible operational constraint pipeline for evaluating detectability of non-ideal channels relative to calibrated device noise.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing use of RDF graphs, storing and querying such data using SPARQL remains a critical problem. Current mainstream solutions rely on cloud-based data management architectures, but often suffer from performance bottle- necks in environments with limited bandwidth or high system load. To address this issue, this paper explores for the first time the integration of edge computing to move graph data storage and processing to edge environments, thereby improving query performance. This approach requires offloading query processing to edge servers, which involves addressing two challenges: data localization and network scheduling. First, the data localization challenge lies in computing the subgraphs maintained on edge servers to quickly identify the servers that can handle specific queries. To address this challenge, we introduce a new concept of pattern-induced subgraphs. Second, the network scheduling challenge involves efficiently assigning queries to edge and cloud servers to optimize overall system performance. We tackle this by constructing a overall system model that jointly captures data distribution, query characteristics, network communication, and computational resources. Accordingly, we further propose a joint formulation of query assignment and computational resource allocation, modeling it as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem and solve this problem using a modified branch-and-bound algorithm. Experimental results on real datasets under a real cloud platform demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of efficiency.

    "abstract": "We introduce $k$-lazyGD, an online learning algorithm that bridges the gap between greedy Online Gradient Descent (OGD, for $k=1$) and lazy GD/dual-averaging (for $k=T$), creating a spectrum between reactive and stable updates. We analyze this spectrum in Smoothed Online Convex Optimization (SOCO), where the learner incurs both hitting and movement costs. Our main contribution is establishing that laziness is possible without sacrificing hitting performance: we prove that $k$-lazyGD achieves the optimal dynamic regret $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{(P_T+1)T})$ for any laziness slack $k$ up to $Θ(\\sqrt{T/P_T})$, where $P_T$ is the comparator path length. This result formally connects the allowable laziness to the comparator's shifts, showing that $k$-lazyGD can retain the inherently small movements of lazy methods without compromising tracking ability. We base our analysis on the Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) framework, and derive a matching lower bound. Since the slack depends on $P_T$, an ensemble of learners with various slacks is used, yielding a method that is provably stable when it can be, and agile when it must be.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare visitation patterns are influenced by a complex interplay of hospital attributes, population socioeconomics, and spatial factors. However, existing research often adopts a fragmented approach, examining these determinants in isolation. This study addresses this gap by integrating hospital capacities, occupancy rates, reputation, and popularity with population SES and spatial mobility patterns to predict visitation flows and analyze influencing factors. Utilizing four years of SafeGraph mobility data and user experience data from Google Maps Reviews, five flow prediction models, Naive Regression, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Deep Gravity, and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNN),were trained and applied to simulate visitation flows in Houston, Texas, U.S. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis and the Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) method were employed to examine the combined impacts of different factors on visitation patterns. The findings reveal that Deep Gravity outperformed other models. Hospital capacities, ICU occupancy rates, ratings, and popularity significantly influence visitation patterns, with their effects varying across different travel distances. Short-distance visits are primarily driven by convenience, whereas long-distance visits are influenced by hospital ratings. White-majority areas exhibited lower sensitivity to hospital ratings for short-distance visits, while Asian populations and those with higher education levels prioritized hospital rating in their visitation decisions. SES further influence these patterns, as areas with higher proportions of Hispanic, Black, under-18, and over-65 populations tend to have more frequent hospital visits, potentially reflecting greater healthcare needs or limited access to alternative medical services.",

    "abstract": "Short-video applications have attracted substantial user traffic. However, these platforms also foster problematic usage patterns, commonly referred to as short-video addiction, which pose risks to both user health and the sustainable development of platforms. Prior studies on this issue have primarily relied on questionnaires or volunteer-based data collection, which are often limited by small sample sizes and population biases. In contrast, short-video platforms have large-scale behavioral data, offering a valuable foundation for analyzing addictive behaviors. To examine addiction-aware behavior patterns, we combine economic addiction theory with users' implicit behavior captured by recommendation systems. Our analysis shows that short-video addiction follows functional patterns similar to traditional forms of addictive behavior (e.g., substance abuse) and that its intensity is consistent with findings from previous social science studies. To develop a simulator that can learn and model these patterns, we introduce a novel training framework, AddictSim. To consider the personalized addiction patterns, AddictSim uses a mean-to-adapted strategy with group relative policy optimization training. Experiments on two large-scale datasets show that AddictSim consistently outperforms existing training strategies. Our simulation results show that integrating diversity-aware algorithms can mitigate addictive behaviors well.",

The performance of PD array-based systems is compared, in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and achievable rate, to that of a reference receiver employing a single PD. Analytical and numerical results show that PD arrays provide performance gains for sufficiently narrow beams and above an SNR threshold. Furthermore, increasing the number of PDs alone does not enhance performance, and joint optimization of beam pattern, transverse electromagnetic mode, received power, and PD positions is necessary. Our model and derived insights provide practical guidelines and highlight the trade-offs for the design of next-generation high-bandwidth PD array receivers.",

Existing alignment methods present a difficult trade-off: fine-tuning approaches suffer from loss of diversity with reward over-optimization, while test-time scaling methods introduce significant computational overhead and tend to under-optimize. To address these limitations, we propose HyperAlign, a novel framework that trains a hypernetwork for efficient and effective test-time alignment. Instead of modifying latent states, HyperAlign dynamically generates low-rank adaptation weights to modulate the diffusion model's generation operators. This allows the denoising trajectory to be adaptively adjusted based on input latents, timesteps and prompts for reward-conditioned alignment. We introduce multiple variants of HyperAlign that differ in how frequently the hypernetwork is applied, balancing between performance and efficiency. Furthermore, we optimize the hypernetwork using a reward score objective regularized with preference data to reduce reward hacking. We evaluate HyperAlign on multiple extended generative paradigms, including Stable Diffusion and FLUX. It significantly outperforms existing fine-tuning and test-time scaling baselines in enhancing semantic consistency and visual appeal.",

It conditions its action predictions on Return-to-Go (RTG), using it both to distinguish trajectory quality during training and to guide action generation at inference. In this work, we identify a critical redundancy in this design: feeding the entire sequence of RTGs into the Transformer is theoretically unnecessary, as only the most recent RTG affects action prediction. We show that this redundancy can impair DT's performance through experiments. To resolve this, we propose the Decoupled DT (DDT). DDT simplifies the architecture by processing only observation and action sequences through the Transformer, using the latest RTG to guide the action prediction. This streamlined approach not only improves performance but also reduces computational cost. Our experiments show that DDT significantly outperforms DT and establishes competitive performance against state-of-the-art DT variants across multiple offline RL tasks.",

    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis (NVS) of static and dynamic urban scenes is essential for autonomous driving simulation, yet existing methods often struggle to balance reconstruction time with quality. While state-of-the-art neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches achieve photorealism, they often rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization. Conversely, emerging feed-forward methods frequently adopt per-pixel Gaussian representations, which lead to 3D inconsistencies when aggregating multi-view predictions in complex, dynamic environments. We propose EvolSplat4D, a feed-forward framework that moves beyond existing per-pixel paradigms by unifying volume-based and pixel-based Gaussian prediction across three specialized branches. For close-range static regions, we predict consistent geometry of 3D Gaussians over multiple frames directly from a 3D feature volume, complemented by a semantically-enhanced image-based rendering module for predicting their appearance. For dynamic actors, we utilize object-centric canonical spaces and a motion-adjusted rendering module to aggregate temporal features, ensuring stable 4D reconstruction despite noisy motion priors. Far-Field scenery is handled by an efficient per-pixel Gaussian branch to ensure full-scene coverage. Experimental results on the KITTI-360, KITTI, Waymo, and PandaSet datasets show that EvolSplat4D reconstructs both static and dynamic environments with superior accuracy and consistency, outperforming both per-scene optimization and state-of-the-art feed-forward baselines.",

    "abstract": "Accurate calibration and robust localization are fundamental for downstream tasks in spinning actuated LiDAR applications. Existing methods, however, require parameterizing extrinsic parameters based on different mounting configurations, limiting their generalizability. Additionally, spinning actuated LiDAR inevitably scans featureless regions, which complicates the balance between scanning coverage and localization robustness. To address these challenges, this letter presents a targetless LiDAR-motor calibration (LM-Calibr) on the basis of the Denavit-Hartenberg convention and an environmental adaptive LiDAR-inertial odometry (EVA-LIO). LM-Calibr supports calibration of LiDAR-motor systems with various mounting configurations. Extensive experiments demonstrate its accuracy and convergence across different scenarios, mounting angles, and initial values. Additionally, EVA-LIO adaptively selects downsample rates and map resolutions according to spatial scale. This adaptivity enables the actuator to operate at maximum speed, thereby enhancing scanning completeness while ensuring robust localization, even when LiDAR briefly scans featureless areas.

    "abstract": "Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) holds unique value in real-world surveillance bridging visual perception and language understanding, yet current paradigms utilizing pre-training models often fail to transfer effectively to complex open-world scenarios. The reliance on \"Passive Observation\" leads to multifaceted spurious correlations and spatial semantic misalignment, causing a lack of robustness against distribution shifts. To fundamentally resolve these defects, this paper proposes ICON (Invariant Counterfactual Optimization with Neuro-symbolic priors), a framework integrating causal and topological priors. First, we introduce Rule-Guided Spatial Intervention to strictly penalize sensitivity to bounding box noise, forcibly severing location shortcuts to achieve geometric invariance. Second, Counterfactual Context Disentanglement is implemented via semantic-driven background transplantation, compelling the model to ignore background interference for environmental independence. Then, we employ Saliency-Driven Semantic Regularization with adaptive masking to resolve local saliency bias and guarantee holistic completeness. Finally, Neuro-Symbolic Topological Alignment utilizes neuro-symbolic priors to constrain feature matching, ensuring activated regions are topologically consistent with human structural logic. Experimental results demonstrate that ICON not only maintains leading performance on standard benchmarks but also exhibits exceptional robustness against occlusion, background interference, and localization noise. This approach effectively advances the field by shifting from fitting statistical co-occurrences to learning causal invariance.",

    "abstract": "Model merging (MM) offers an efficient mechanism for integrating multiple specialized models without access to original training data or costly retraining. While MM has demonstrated success in domains like computer vision, its role in recommender systems (RSs) remains largely unexplored. Recently, Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in RSs, characterized by rapidly growing model scales and substantial computational costs, making MM particularly appealing for cost-sensitive deployment scenarios. In this work, we present the first systematic study of MM in GR through a contextual lens. We focus on a fundamental yet underexplored challenge in real-world: how to merge generative recommenders specialized to different real-world contexts, arising from temporal evolving user behaviors and heterogeneous application domains. To this end, we propose a unified framework MMGRid, a structured contextual grid of GR checkpoints that organizes models trained under diverse contexts induced by temporal evolution and domain diversity. All checkpoints are derived from a shared base LLM but fine-tuned on context-specific data, forming a realistic and controlled model space for systematically analyzing MM across GR paradigms and merging algorithms. Our investigation reveals several key insights. First, training GR models from LLMs can introduce parameter conflicts during merging due to token distribution shifts and objective disparities; such conflicts can be alleviated by disentangling task-aware and context-specific parameter changes via base model replacement. Second, incremental training across contexts induces recency bias, which can be effectively balanced through weighted contextual merging. Notably, we observe that optimal merging weights correlate with context-dependent interaction characteristics, offering practical guidance for weight selection in real-world deployments.",

    "abstract": "Neuron segmentation is the cornerstone of reconstructing comprehensive neuronal connectomes, which is essential for deciphering the functional organization of the brain. The irregular morphology and densely intertwined structures of neurons make this task particularly challenging. Prevailing CNN-based methods often fail to resolve ambiguous boundaries due to the lack of long-range context, whereas Transformer-based methods suffer from boundary imprecision caused by the loss of voxel-level details during patch partitioning. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroMamba, a multi-perspective framework that exploits the linear complexity of Mamba to enable patch-free global modeling and synergizes this with complementary local feature modeling, thereby efficiently capturing long-range dependencies while meticulously preserving fine-grained voxel details. Specifically, we design a channel-gated Boundary Discriminative Feature Extractor (BDFE) to enhance local morphological cues. Complementing this, we introduce the Spatial Continuous Feature Extractor (SCFE), which integrates a resolution-aware scanning mechanism into the Visual Mamba architecture to adaptively model global dependencies across varying data resolutions. Finally, a cross-modulation mechanism synergistically fuses these multi-perspective features. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across four public EM datasets, validating its exceptional adaptability to both anisotropic and isotropic resolutions.

    "abstract": "Deep neural network models degrade significantly in the long-tailed data distribution, with the overall training data dominated by a small set of classes in the head, and the tail classes obtaining less training examples. Addressing the imbalance in the classes, attention in the related literature was given mainly to the adjustments carried out in the decision space in terms of either corrections performed at the logit level in order to compensate class-prior bias, with the least attention to the optimization process resulting from the adjustments introduced through the differences in the confidences among the samples. In the current study, we present the design of a class and confidence-aware re-weighting scheme for long-tailed learning. This scheme is purely based upon the loss level and has a complementary nature to the existing methods performing the adjustment of the logits. In the practical implementation stage of the proposed scheme, we use an Ω(p_t, f_c) function. This function enables the modulation of the contribution towards the training task based upon the confidence value of the prediction, as well as the relative frequency of the corresponding class. Our observations in the experiments are corroborated by significant experimental results performed on the CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018 datasets under various values of imbalance factors that clearly authenticate the theoretical discussions above.",

    "title": "A Multi-View Pipeline and Benchmark Dataset for 3D Hand Pose Estimation in Surgery",
    "abstract": "Purpose: Accurate 3D hand pose estimation supports surgical applications such as skill assessment, robot-assisted interventions, and geometry-aware workflow analysis. However, surgical environments pose severe challenges, including intense and localized lighting, frequent occlusions by instruments or staff, and uniform hand appearance due to gloves, combined with a scarcity of annotated datasets for reliable model training.   Method: We propose a robust multi-view pipeline for 3D hand pose estimation in surgical contexts that requires no domain-specific fine-tuning and relies solely on off-the-shelf pretrained models. The pipeline integrates reliable person detection, whole-body pose estimation, and state-of-the-art 2D hand keypoint prediction on tracked hand crops, followed by a constrained 3D optimization. In addition, we introduce a novel surgical benchmark dataset comprising over 68,000 frames and 3,000 manually annotated 2D hand poses with triangulated 3D ground truth, recorded in a replica operating room under varying levels of scene complexity.   Results: Quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines, achieving a 31% reduction in 2D mean joint error and a 76% reduction in 3D mean per-joint position error.   Conclusion: Our work establishes a strong baseline for 3D hand pose estimation in surgery, providing both a training-free pipeline and a comprehensive annotated dataset to facilitate future research in surgical computer vision.",

We prove that, under mild regularity conditions, Prog-PowerHP converges to a small neighborhood of the global optimum with an iteration complexity scaling nearly as $O(d^2\\varepsilon^{-2})$. Empirically, Prog-PowerHP demonstrates clear advantages in phase retrieval when the samples-to-dimension ratio approaches the information-theoretic limit, and in training two-layer neural networks in under-parameterized regimes. These results suggest that Prog-PowerHP is particularly effective for navigating cluttered non-convex landscapes where standard first-order methods struggle.",

    "abstract": "In the realm of Virtual Reality (VR) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), real-time emotion recognition shows promise for supporting individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in improving social skills. This task requires a strict latency-accuracy trade-off, with motion-to-photon (MTP) latency kept below 140 ms to maintain contingency. However, most off-the-shelf Deep Learning models prioritize accuracy over the strict timing constraints of commodity hardware. As a first step toward accessible VR therapy, we benchmark State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models for Zero-Shot Facial Expression Recognition (FER) on virtual characters using the UIBVFED dataset. We evaluate Medium and Nano variants of YOLO (v8, v11, and v12) for face detection, alongside general-purpose Vision Transformers including CLIP, SigLIP, and ViT-FER.Our results on CPU-only inference demonstrate that while face detection on stylized avatars is robust (100% accuracy), a \"Latency Wall\" exists in the classification stage. The YOLOv11n architecture offers the optimal balance for detection (~54 ms). However, general-purpose Transformers like CLIP and SigLIP fail to achieve viable accuracy (<23%) or speed (>150 ms) for real-time loops. This study highlights the necessity for lightweight, domain-specific architectures to enable accessible, real-time AI in therapeutic settings.",

    "abstract": "Robots that follow natural-language instructions often either plan at a high level using hand-designed interfaces or rely on large end-to-end models that are difficult to deploy for real-time control. We propose TeNet (Text-to-Network), a framework for instantiating compact, task-specific robot policies directly from natural language descriptions. TeNet conditions a hypernetwork on text embeddings produced by a pretrained large language model (LLM) to generate a fully executable policy, which then operates solely on low-dimensional state inputs at high control frequencies. By using the language only once at the policy instantiation time, TeNet inherits the general knowledge and paraphrasing robustness of pretrained LLMs while remaining lightweight and efficient at execution time. To improve generalization, we optionally ground language in behavior during training by aligning text embeddings with demonstrated actions, while requiring no demonstrations at inference time. Experiments on MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks show that TeNet produces policies that are orders of magnitude smaller than sequence-based baselines, while achieving strong performance in both multi-task and meta-learning settings and supporting high-frequency control. These results show that text-conditioned hypernetworks offer a practical way to build compact, language-driven controllers for ressource-constrained robot control tasks with real-time requirements.",

MEG data from 21 participants performing imagined speech tasks were projected into three spatial scalogram mixtures via a learnable sensor-space convolution, producing compact image-like inputs for ImageNet-pretrained vision architectures. These models outperformed classical and non-pretrained models, achieving up to 90.4% balanced accuracy for imagery vs. silence, 81.0% vs. silent reading, and 60.6% for vowel decoding. Cross-subject evaluation confirmed that pretrained models capture shared neural representations, and temporal analyses localized discriminative information to imagery-locked intervals. These findings show that pretrained vision models applied to image-based MEG representations can effectively capture the structure of imagined speech in non-invasive neural signals.",

    "abstract": "Understanding where and how emotions are represented in large-scale foundation models remains an open problem, particularly in multimodal affective settings. Despite the strong empirical performance of recent affective models, the internal architectural mechanisms that support affective understanding and generation are still poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic mechanistic study of affective modeling in multimodal foundation models. Across multiple architectures, training strategies, and affective tasks, we analyze how emotion-oriented supervision reshapes internal model parameters. Our results consistently reveal a clear and robust pattern: affective adaptation does not primarily focus on the attention module, but instead localizes to the feed-forward gating projection (\\texttt{gate\\_proj}). Through controlled module transfer, targeted single-module adaptation, and destructive ablation, we further demonstrate that \\texttt{gate\\_proj} is sufficient, efficient, and necessary for affective understanding and generation. Notably, by tuning only approximately 24.5\\% of the parameters tuned by AffectGPT, our approach achieves 96.6\\% of its average performance across eight affective tasks, highlighting substantial parameter efficiency. Together, these findings provide empirical evidence that affective capabilities in foundation models are structurally mediated by feed-forward gating mechanisms and identify \\texttt{gate\\_proj} as a central architectural locus of affective modeling.",

In particular, system performance is further degraded when switching delays are stochastic and inhomogeneous.

This paper introduces ACI, a non-myopic, frame-based scheduling framework that directly amortizes these switching delays. We first use a Lyapunov drift analysis to prove that backlog-driven ACI is throughput-optimal with respect to a scaled capacity region; then validate ACI's effectiveness on multi-UAV networks with an FSO backhaul. Finally, we demonstrate how adapting its core urgency metric provides the flexibility to navigate the throughput-latency trade-off.",

Most existing approaches for code-identification are contingent upon the codes in the family having some special structure, and are often computationally expensive otherwise. Further, rigorous analytical guarantees on the performance of these existing techniques are largely absent. This work presents a new method for code-identification on the binary symmetric channel (BSC), inspired by the framework of subspace codes for operator channels, carefully combining principles of hamming-metric and subspace-metric decoding. We refer to this method as the minimum denoised subspace discrepancy decoder. We present theoretical guarantees for code-identification using this decoder, for bounded-weight errors, and also present a bound on the probability of error when used on the BSC. Simulations demonstrate the improved performance of our decoder for random linear codes beyond existing general-purpose techniques, across most channel conditions and even with a limited number of received vectors.",

    "abstract": "Multi-modal scene reconstruction integrating RGB and thermal infrared data is essential for robust environmental perception across diverse lighting and weather conditions. However, extending 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to multi-spectral scenarios remains challenging. Current approaches often struggle to fully leverage the complementary information of multi-modal data, typically relying on mechanisms that either tend to neglect cross-modal correlations or leverage shared representations that fail to adaptively handle the complex structural correlations and physical discrepancies between spectrums. To address these limitations, we propose ThermoSplat, a novel framework that enables deep spectral-aware reconstruction through active feature modulation and adaptive geometry decoupling. First, we introduce a Cross-Modal FiLM Modulation mechanism that dynamically conditions shared latent features on thermal structural priors, effectively guiding visible texture synthesis with reliable cross-modal geometric cues. Second, to accommodate modality-specific geometric inconsistencies, we propose a Modality-Adaptive Geometric Decoupling scheme that learns independent opacity offsets and executes an independent rasterization pass for the thermal branch. Additionally, a hybrid rendering pipeline is employed to integrate explicit Spherical Harmonics with implicit neural decoding, ensuring both semantic consistency and high-frequency detail preservation. Extensive experiments on the RGBT-Scenes dataset demonstrate that ThermoSplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality across both visible and thermal spectrums.",

Yet, dominant alignment approaches remain model centric, treating users as passive recipients of prespecified values rather than as epistemic agents who encounter and respond to misalignment during interactions. Drawing on situated perspectives, we frame alignment as an interactional practice co-constructed during human AI interaction. We investigate how users understand and wish to contribute to this process through a participatory workshop that combines misalignment diaries with generative design activities. We surface how misalignments materialise in practice and how users envision acting on them, grounded in the context of researchers using Large Language Models as research assistants. Our findings show that misalignments are experienced less as abstract ethical violations than as unexpected responses, and task or social breakdowns. Participants articulated roles ranging from adjusting and interpreting model behaviour to deliberate non-engagement as an alignment strategy. We conclude with implications for designing systems that support alignment as an ongoing, situated, and shared practice.",

To enable efficient knowledge learning and stable training, we incorporate a block diffusion continual pretraining (CPT) stage enhanced by a tailored warmup and block-wise clipped noise schedule.

    "abstract": "Monadic stability generalizes many tameness notions from structural graph theory such as planarity, bounded degree, bounded tree-width, and nowhere density. The sparsification conjecture predicts that the (possibly dense) monadically stable graph classes are exactly those that can be logically encoded by first-order (FO) transductions in the (always sparse) nowhere dense classes. So far this conjecture has been verified for several special cases, such as for classes of bounded shrub-depth, and for the monadically stable fragments of bounded (linear) clique-width, twin-width, and merge-width.   In this work we propose the existential positive sparsification conjecture, predicting that the more restricted co-matching-free, monadically stable classes are exactly those that can be transduced from nowhere dense classes using only existential positive FO formulas. While the general conjecture remains open, we verify its truth for all known special cases of the original conjecture. Even stronger, we find the sparse preimages as subgraphs of the dense input graphs.   As a key ingredient, we introduce a new combinatorial operation, called subflip, that arises as the natural co-matching-free analog of the flip operation, which is a central tool in the characterization of monadic stability. Using subflips, we characterize the co-matching-free fragment of monadic stability by appropriate strengthenings of the known flip-flatness and flipper game characterizations for monadic stability. In an attempt to generalize our results to the more expressive MSO logic, we discover (rediscover?) that on relational structures (existential) positive MSO has the same expressive power as (existential) positive FO.",

This paper proposes a hybrid GFANC-FxNLMS algorithm to leverage the complementary advantages of both approaches. In the hybrid GFANC-FxNLMS algorithm, GFANC provides a frame-level control filter as an initialization for FxNLMS, while FxNLMS performs continuous adaptation at the sampling rate. Small variations in the GFANC-generated filter may repeatedly reinitialize FxNLMS, interrupting its adaptation process and destabilizing the system. An online clustering module is introduced to avoid unnecessary re-initializations and improve system stability. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves fast response, very low steady-state error, and high stability, requiring only one pre-trained broadband filter.",

    "title": "Understanding the Transfer Limits of Vision Foundation Models",
    "abstract": "Foundation models leverage large-scale pretraining to capture extensive knowledge, demonstrating generalization in a wide range of language tasks. By comparison, vision foundation models (VFMs) often exhibit uneven improvements across downstream tasks, despite substantial computational investment. We postulate that this limitation arises from a mismatch between pretraining objectives and the demands of downstream vision-and-imaging tasks. Pretraining strategies like masked image reconstruction or contrastive learning shape representations for tasks such as recovery of generic visual patterns or global semantic structures, which may not align with the task-specific requirements of downstream applications including segmentation, classification, or image synthesis. To investigate this in a concrete real-world clinical area, we assess two VFMs, a reconstruction-focused MAE-based model (ProFound) and a contrastive-learning-based model (ProViCNet), on five prostate multiparametric MR imaging tasks, examining how such task alignment influences transfer performance, i.e., from pretraining to fine-tuning. Our findings indicate that better alignment between pretraining and downstream tasks, measured by simple divergence metrics such as maximum-mean-discrepancy (MMD) between the same features before and after fine-tuning, correlates with greater performance improvements and faster convergence, emphasizing the importance of designing and analyzing pretraining objectives with downstream applicability in mind.",

    "abstract": "Contrast medium plays a pivotal role in radiological imaging, as it amplifies lesion conspicuity and improves detection for the diagnosis of tumor-related diseases. However, depending on the patient's health condition or the medical resources available, the use of contrast medium is not always feasible. Recent work has explored AI-based image translation to synthesize contrast-enhanced images directly from non-contrast scans, aims to reduce side effects and streamlines clinical workflows. Progress in this direction has been constrained by data limitations: (1) existing public datasets focus almost exclusively on brain-related paired MR modalities; (2) other collections include partially paired data but suffer from missing modalities/timestamps and imperfect spatial alignment; (3) explicit labeling of CT vs. CTC or DCE phases is often absent; (4) substantial resources remain private. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first public, fully paired, pan-cancer medical imaging dataset spanning 11 human organs. The MR data include complete dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequences covering all three phases (DCE1-DCE3), while the CT data provide paired non-contrast and contrast-enhanced acquisitions (CTC). The dataset is curated for anatomical correspondence, enabling rigorous evaluation of 1-to-1, N-to-1, and N-to-N translation settings (e.g., predicting DCE phases from non-contrast inputs). Built upon this resource, we establish a comprehensive benchmark. We report results from representative baselines of contemporary image-to-image translation. We release the dataset and benchmark to catalyze research on safe, effective contrast synthesis, with direct relevance to multi-organ oncology imaging workflows.

    "abstract": "Code completion has become a central task, gaining significant attention with the rise of large language model (LLM)-based tools in software engineering. Although recent advances have greatly improved LLMs' code completion abilities, evaluation methods have not advanced equally. Most current benchmarks focus solely on functional correctness of code completions based on given context, overlooking models' ability to follow user instructions during completion-a common scenario in LLM-assisted programming. To address this limitation, we present the first instruction-guided code completion benchmark, Controllable Code Completion Benchmark (C3-Bench), comprising 2,195 carefully designed completion tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation of over 40 mainstream LLMs across C3-Bench and conventional benchmarks, we reveal substantial gaps in instruction-following capabilities between open-source and advanced proprietary models during code completion tasks. Moreover, we develop a straightforward data synthesis pipeline that leverages Qwen2.5-Coder to generate high-quality instruction-completion pairs for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The resulting model, Qwen2.5-Coder-C3, achieves state-of-the-art performance on C3-Bench. Our findings provide valuable insights for enhancing LLMs' code completion and instruction-following capabilities, establishing new directions for future research in code LLMs. To facilitate reproducibility and foster further research in code LLMs, we open-source all code, datasets, and models.",

    "abstract": "The development of native computer-use agents (CUA) represents a significant leap in multimodal AI. However, their potential is currently bottlenecked by the constraints of static data scaling. Existing paradigms relying primarily on passive imitation of static datasets struggle to capture the intricate causal dynamics inherent in long-horizon computer tasks. In this work, we introduce EvoCUA, a native computer use agentic model. Unlike static imitation, EvoCUA integrates data generation and policy optimization into a self-sustaining evolutionary cycle. To mitigate data scarcity, we develop a verifiable synthesis engine that autonomously generates diverse tasks coupled with executable validators. To enable large-scale experience acquisition, we design a scalable infrastructure orchestrating tens of thousands of asynchronous sandbox rollouts. Building on these massive trajectories, we propose an iterative evolving learning strategy to efficiently internalize this experience. This mechanism dynamically regulates policy updates by identifying capability boundaries -- reinforcing successful routines while transforming failure trajectories into rich supervision through error analysis and self-correction. Empirical evaluations on the OSWorld benchmark demonstrate that EvoCUA achieves a success rate of 56.7%, establishing a new open-source state-of-the-art. Notably, EvoCUA significantly outperforms the previous best open-source model, OpenCUA-72B (45.0%), and surpasses leading closed-weights models such as UI-TARS-2 (53.1%). Crucially, our results underscore the generalizability of this approach: the evolving paradigm driven by learning from experience yields consistent performance gains across foundation models of varying scales, establishing a robust and scalable path for advancing native agent capabilities.",

Despite their significance in identifying records belonging to the training dataset, several concerns remain unexplored, particularly with regard to tabular data. In this paper, first, we provide an extensive review and analysis of MIAs considering two main learning paradigms: centralized and federated learning. We extend and refine the taxonomy for both. Second, we demonstrate the efficacy of MIAs in tabular data using several attack strategies, also including defenses. Furthermore, in a federated learning scenario, we consider the threat posed by an outsider adversary, which is often neglected. Third, we demonstrate the high vulnerability of single-outs (records with a unique signature) to MIAs. Lastly, we explore how MIAs transfer across model architectures. Our results point towards a general poor performance of these attacks in tabular data which contrasts with previous state-of-the-art. Notably, even attacks with limited attack performance can still successfully expose a large portion of single-outs. Moreover, our findings suggest that using different surrogate models makes MIAs more effective.",

    "abstract": "Inference in large-scale AI models is typically performed on dense parameter matrices, leading to inference cost and system complexity that scale unsustainably with model size. This limitation does not arise from insufficient model capacity, but from treating post-training inference systems as monolithic operators while ignoring internal structures formed during learning. We show that gradient update events in large models are highly localized and selective, leaving many parameter dependencies statistically indistinguishable from their initialization distribution after training. As a result, post-training inference systems are structurally non-uniform and inherently decomposable. Based on this observation, we introduce a post-training statistical criterion and a structural annealing procedure that removes unsupported dependencies and reveals stable, independent substructures. This work establishes a post-training, model-agnostic structural view of inference systems and enables structured, parallel inference without modifying model functionality or interfaces.",

However, AV-HuBERT showed a deterministic bias toward phonetic fusion (68.0%), significantly exceeding human rates (47.7%).

However, in real-world clinical settings, angiographic images are often characterized by complex lesion morphology, severe class imbalance, label uncertainty, and limited computational resources, posing substantial challenges to conventional deep learning approaches in terms of robustness and generalization.Methods: The proposed framework is built upon a pretrained convolutional neural network to construct a lightweight hybrid neural representation. A selective neural plasticity training strategy is introduced to enable efficient parameter adaptation. Furthermore, a brain-inspired attention-modulated loss function, combining Focal Loss with label smoothing, is employed to enhance sensitivity to hard samples and uncertain annotations. Class-imbalance-aware sampling and cosine annealing with warm restarts are adopted to mimic rhythmic regulation and attention allocation mechanisms observed in biological neural systems.Results: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight brain-inspired model achieves strong and stable performance in binary coronary angiography classification, yielding competitive accuracy, recall, F1-score, and AUC metrics while maintaining high computational efficiency.Conclusion: This study validates the effectiveness of brain-inspired learning mechanisms in lightweight medical image analysis and provides a biologically plausible and deployable solution for intelligent clinical decision support under limited computational resources.",

    "abstract": "House allocation is an extremely well-studied problem in the field of fair allocation, where the goal is to assign $n$ houses to $n$ agents while satisfying certain fairness criterion, e.g., envy-freeness. To model social interactions, the Graphical House Allocation framework introduces a social graph $G$, in which each vertex corresponds to an agent, and an edge $(u, v)$ corresponds to the potential of agent $u$ to envy the agent $v$, based on their allocations and valuations. In undirected social graphs, the potential for envy is in both the directions. In the Minimum Envy Graphical House Allocation (ME-GHA) problem, given a set of $n$ agents, $n$ houses, a social graph, and agent's valuation functions, the goal is to find an allocation that minimizes the total envy summed up over all the edges of $G$. Recent work, [Hosseini et al., AAMAS 2023, AAMAS 2024] studied ME-GHA in the regime of polynomial-time algorithms, and designed exact and approximation algorithms, for certain graph classes under identical agent valuations. We initiate the study of \\gha with non-identical valuations, a setting that has so far remained unexplored. We investigate the multivariate (parameterized) complexity of \\gha by identifying structural restrictions on the social graph and valuation functions that yield tractability. We also design moderately exponential-time algorithms for several graph classes, and a polynomial-time algorithm for {binary valuations that returns an allocation with envy at most one when the social graph has maximum degree at most one.",

The tree-independence number of a graph $G$ is the minimum independence number of a tree decomposition of $G$. As shown recently by Lima et al. [ESA~2024], a large family of optimization problems asking for a maximum-weight induced subgraph of bounded treewidth, satisfying a given \\textsf{CMSO}$_2$ property, can be solved in polynomial time in graphs whose tree-independence number is bounded by some constant~$k$.   However, the complexity of the algorithm of Lima et al. grows rapidly with $k$, making it useless if the tree-independence number is superconstant. In this paper we present a refined version of the algorithm. We show that the same family of problems can be solved in time~$n^{\\mathcal{O}(k)}$, where $n$ is the number of vertices of the instance, $k$ is the tree-independence number, and the $\\mathcal{O}(\\cdot)$-notation hides factors depending on the treewidth bound of the solution and the considered \\textsf{CMSO}$_2$ property.   This running time is quasipolynomial for classes of graphs with polylogarithmic tree-independence number; several such classes were recently discovered.

    "abstract": "Table retrieval is the task of retrieving the most relevant tables from large-scale corpora given natural language queries. However, structural and semantic discrepancies between unstructured text and structured tables make embedding alignment particularly challenging. Recent methods such as QGpT attempt to enrich table semantics by generating synthetic queries, yet they still rely on coarse partial-table sampling and simple fusion strategies, which limit semantic diversity and hinder effective query-table alignment. We propose STAR (Semantic Table Representation), a lightweight framework that improves semantic table representation through semantic clustering and weighted fusion. STAR first applies header-aware K-means clustering to group semantically similar rows and selects representative centroid instances to construct a diverse partial table. It then generates cluster-specific synthetic queries to comprehensively cover the table's semantic space. Finally, STAR employs weighted fusion strategies to integrate table and query embeddings, enabling fine-grained semantic alignment. This design enables STAR to capture complementary information from structured and textual sources, improving the expressiveness of table representations. Experiments on five benchmarks show that STAR achieves consistently higher Recall than QGpT on all datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of semantic clustering and adaptive weighted fusion for robust table representation.

    "abstract": "In parliamentary elections, parties compete for a limited, typically fixed number of seats. Most parliaments are assembled using apportionment methods that distribute the seats based on the parties' vote counts. Common apportionment methods include divisor sequence methods (like D'Hondt or Sainte-Laguë), the largest-remainder method, and first-past-the-post. In many countries, an electoral threshold is implemented to prevent very small parties from entering the parliament. Further, several countries have apportionment systems that incorporate multiple districts. We study how computationally hard it is to change the election outcome (i.e., to increase or limit the influence of a distinguished party) by convincing a limited number of voters to change their vote. We refer to these bribery-style attacks as \\emph{strategic campaigns} and study the corresponding problems in terms of their computational (both classical and parameterized) complexity. We also run extensive experiments on real-world election data and study the effectiveness of optimal campaigns, in particular as opposed to using heuristic bribing strategies and with respect to the influence of the threshold and the influence of the number of districts. For apportionment elections with threshold, finally, we propose -- as an alternative to the standard top-choice mode -- the second-chance mode where voters of parties below the threshold receive a second chance to vote for another party, and we establish computational complexity results also in this setting.",

    "title": "Practical applications of Set Shaping Theory to Non-Uniform Sequences",
    "abstract": "Set Shaping Theory (SST) moves beyond the classical fixed-space model by constructing bijective mappings the original sequence set into structured regions of a larger sequence space. These shaped subsets are characterized by a reduced average information content, measured by the product of the empirical entropy and the length, yielding (N +k)H0(f(s)) < NH0(s), which represents the universal coding limit when the source distribution is unknown. The principal experimental difficulty in applying Set Shaping Theory to non-uniform sequences arises from the need to order the sequences of both the original and transformed sets according to their information content. An exact ordering of these sets entails exponential complexity, rendering a direct implementation impractical. In this article, we show that this obstacle can be overcome by performing an approximate but informative ordering that preserves the structural requirements of SST while achieving the shaping gain predicted by the theory. This result extends previous experimental findings obtained for uniformly distributed sequences and demonstrates that the shaping advantage of SST persists for non-uniform sequences. Finally, to ensure full reproducibility, the software implementing the proposed method has been made publicly available on GitHub, enabling independent verification of the results reported in this work",

    "title": "CGPT: Cluster-Guided Partial Tables with LLM-Generated Supervision for Table Retrieval",
    "abstract": "General-purpose embedding models have demonstrated strong performance in text retrieval but remain suboptimal for table retrieval, where highly structured content leads to semantic compression and query-table mismatch. Recent LLM-based retrieval augmentation methods mitigate this issue by generating synthetic queries, yet they often rely on heuristic partial-table selection and seldom leverage these synthetic queries as supervision to improve the embedding model. We introduce CGPT, a training framework that enhances table retrieval through LLM-generated supervision. CGPT constructs semantically diverse partial tables by clustering table instances using K-means and sampling across clusters to broaden semantic coverage. An LLM then generates synthetic queries for these partial tables, which are used in hard-negative contrastive fine-tuning to refine the embedding model. Experiments across four public benchmarks (MimoTable, OTTQA, FetaQA, and E2E-WTQ) show that CGPT consistently outperforms retrieval baselines, including QGpT, with an average R@1 improvement of 16.54 percent. In a unified multi-domain corpus setting, CGPT further demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization and remains effective even when using smaller LLMs for synthetic query generation. These results indicate that semantically guided partial-table construction, combined with contrastive training from LLM-generated supervision, provides an effective and scalable paradigm for large-scale table retrieval.

For that, 200-500 documents are typically annotated. The number is constrained by time and costs and lacks justification of the sample size requirements and their relationship to text vocabulary properties.   Methods: Using the publicly available MIMIC-III dataset containing hospital discharge notes with ICD-9 diagnoses as labels, we employed pre-trained BERT embeddings followed by Random Forest classifiers to identify 10 randomly selected diagnoses, varying training corpus sizes from 100 to 10,000 documents, and analyzed vocabulary properties by identifying strong and noisy predictive words through Lasso logistic regression on bag-of-words embeddings.   Results: Learning curves varied significantly across the 10 classification tasks despite identical preprocessing and algorithms, with 600 documents sufficient to achieve 95% of the performance attainable with 10,000 documents for all tasks. Vocabulary analysis revealed that more strong predictors and fewer noisy predictors were associated with steeper learning curves, where every 100 additional noisy words decreased accuracy by approximately 0.02 while 100 additional strong predictors increased maximum accuracy by approximately 0.04.",

    "abstract": "With the growing demand for device-free and privacy-preserving sensing solutions, Wi-Fi sensing has emerged as a promising approach for human pose estimation (HPE). However, existing methods often process vast amounts of channel state information (CSI) data directly, ultimately straining networking resources. This paper introduces TinySense, an efficient compression framework that enhances the scalability of Wi-Fi-based human sensing. Our approach is based on a new vector quantization-based generative adversarial network (VQGAN). Specifically, by leveraging a VQGAN-learned codebook, TinySense significantly reduces CSI data while maintaining the accuracy required for reliable HPE. To optimize compression, we employ the K-means algorithm to dynamically adjust compression bitrates to cluster a large-scale pre-trained codebook into smaller subsets. Furthermore, a Transformer model is incorporated to mitigate bitrate loss, enhancing robustness in unreliable networking conditions. We prototype TinySense on an experimental testbed using Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi to measure latency and network resource use. Extensive results demonstrate that TinySense significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compression schemes, achieving up to 1.5x higher HPE accuracy score (PCK20) under the same compression rate. It also reduces latency and networking overhead, respectively, by up to 5x and 2.5x. The code repository is available online at here.",

    "abstract": "Accurate classification of Radio-Frequency (RF) signals is essential for reliable wearable health-monitoring systems, providing awareness of the interference conditions in which medical protocols operate. In the overcrowded 2.4 GHz ISM band, however, identifying low-power transmissions from medical sensors is challenging due to strong co-channel interference and substantial power asymmetry with coexisting technologies. This work introduces the first open source framework for automatic recognition of SmartBAN signals in Body Area Networks (BANs). The framework combines a synthetic dataset of simulated signals with real RF acquisitions obtained through Software-Defined Radios (SDRs), enabling both controlled and realistic evaluation. Deep convolutional neural networks based on ResNet encoders and U-Net decoders with attention mechanisms are trained and assessed across diverse propagation conditions. The proposed approach achieves over 90% accuracy on synthetic datasets and demonstrates consistent performance on real over-the-air spectrograms. By enabling reliable SmartBAN signal recognition in dense spectral environments, this framework supports interferenceaware coexistence strategies and improves the dependability of wearable healthcare systems.",

Traditional farming methods rely on manual observation and periodic watering, often leading to water wastage, inconsistent plant growth, and delayed response to environmental changes. This paper presents a comprehensive IoT-based smart plant monitoring system that integrates multiple environmental sensors with automated irrigation and cloud analytics. The proposed system utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller to collect real-time data from DHT22 (temperature/humidity), HC-SR04 (water level), and soil moisture sensors, with visual feedback through an OLED display and auditory alerts via a buzzer. All sensor data is wirelessly transmitted to the ThingSpeak cloud platform for remote monitoring, historical analysis, and automated alert generation. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in maintaining optimal soil moisture levels (with 92\\% accuracy), providing real-time environmental monitoring, and reducing water consumption by approximately 40\\% compared to conventional irrigation methods. The integrated web dashboard offers comprehensive visualization of plant health parameters, making it suitable for both small-scale gardening and commercial agriculture applications. With a total implementation cost of \\$45.20, this system provides an affordable, scalable solution for precision agriculture and smart farming.",

    "title": "Towards Realistic Remote Sensing Dataset Distillation with Discriminative Prototype-guided Diffusion",
    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the remarkable success of deep learning in remote sensing image interpretation, driven by the availability of large-scale benchmark datasets. However, this reliance on massive training data also brings two major challenges: (1) high storage and computational costs, and (2) the risk of data leakage, especially when sensitive categories are involved. To address these challenges, this study introduces the concept of dataset distillation into the field of remote sensing image interpretation for the first time. Specifically, we train a text-to-image diffusion model to condense a large-scale remote sensing dataset into a compact and representative distilled dataset. To improve the discriminative quality of the synthesized samples, we propose a classifier-driven guidance by injecting a classification consistency loss from a pre-trained model into the diffusion training process. Besides, considering the rich semantic complexity of remote sensing imagery, we further perform latent space clustering on training samples to select representative and diverse prototypes as visual style guidance, while using a visual language model to provide aggregated text descriptions. Experiments on three high-resolution remote sensing scene classification benchmarks show that the proposed method can distill realistic and diverse samples for downstream model training. Code and pre-trained models are available online (https://github.com/YonghaoXu/DPD).",

Sixty-nine translators took part in an in-person experiment, where they assessed three anonymized short stories - two written by ChatGPT-4o and one by a human author. For each story, participants rated the likelihood of AI authorship and provided justifications for their choices. While average results were inconclusive, a statistically significant subset (16.2%) successfully distinguished the synthetic texts from the human text, suggesting that their judgements were informed by analytical skill rather than chance. However, a nearly equal number misclassified the texts in the opposite direction, often relying on subjective impressions rather than objective markers, possibly reflecting a reader preference for AI-generated texts. Low burstiness and narrative contradiction emerged as the most reliable indicators of synthetic authorship, with unexpected calques, semantic loans and syntactic transfer from English also reported. In contrast, features such as grammatical accuracy and emotional tone frequently led to misclassification. These findings raise questions about the role and scope of synthetic-text editing in professional contexts.",

Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation provides a promising solution by triggering keyword-based retrieval and incorporating external knowledge, thus enabling both efficient and accurate evidence selection.

In this paper, we propose ExDR, an Explanation-driven Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Multimodal Fake News Detection. Our framework systematically leverages model-generated explanations in both the retrieval triggering and evidence retrieval modules. It assesses triggering confidence from three complementary dimensions, constructs entity-aware indices by fusing deceptive entities, and retrieves contrastive evidence based on deception-specific features to challenge the initial claim and enhance the final prediction. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, AMG and MR2, demonstrate that ExDR consistently outperforms previous methods in retrieval triggering accuracy, retrieval quality, and overall detection performance, highlighting its effectiveness and generalization capability.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive traffic signal control (TSC) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in managing dynamic traffic flows. However, conventional methods often struggle when unforeseen traffic incidents occur (e.g., accidents and road maintenance), which typically require labor-intensive and inefficient manual interventions by traffic police officers. Large Language Models (LLMs) appear to be a promising solution thanks to their remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, existing works often propose to replace existing TSC systems with LLM-based systems, which can be (i) unreliable due to the inherent hallucinations of LLMs and (ii) costly due to the need for system replacement. To address the issues of existing works, we propose a hierarchical framework that augments existing TSC systems with LLMs, whereby a virtual traffic police agent at the upper level dynamically fine-tunes selected parameters of signal controllers at the lower level in response to real-time traffic incidents. To enhance domain-specific reliability in response to unforeseen traffic incidents, we devise a self-refined traffic language retrieval system (TLRS), whereby retrieval-augmented generation is employed to draw knowledge from a tailored traffic language database that encompasses traffic conditions and controller operation principles. Moreover, we devise an LLM-based verifier to update the TLRS continuously over the reasoning process. Our results show that LLMs can serve as trustworthy virtual traffic police officers that can adapt conventional TSC methods to unforeseen traffic incidents with significantly improved operational efficiency and reliability.",

    "abstract": "The Shortest Common Superstring (SCS) problem asks for the shortest string that contains each of a given set of strings as a substring. Its reverse-complement variant, the Shortest Common Superstring problem with Reverse Complements (SCS-RC), naturally arises in bioinformatics applications, where for each input string, either the string itself or its reverse complement must appear as a substring of the superstring. The well-known MGREEDY algorithm for the standard SCS constructs a superstring by first computing an optimal cycle cover on the overlap graph and then concatenating the strings corresponding to the cycles, while its refined variant, TGREEDY, further improves the approximation ratio. Although the original 4- and 3-approximation bounds of these algorithms have been successively improved for the standard SCS, no such progress has been made for the reverse-complement setting. A previous study extended MGREEDY to SCS-RC with a 4-approximation guarantee and briefly suggested that extending TGREEDY to the reverse-complement setting could achieve a 3-approximation. In this work, we strengthen these results by proving that the extensions of MGREEDY and TGREEDY to the reverse-complement setting achieve 3.75- and 2.875-approximation ratios, respectively. Our analysis extends the classical proofs for the standard SCS to handle the bidirectional overlaps introduced by reverse complements. These results provide the first formal improvement of approximation guarantees for SCS-RC, with the 2.875-approximate algorithm currently representing the best known bound for this problem.",

We enable ecologists to experiment with ML models independently, thus they can move beyond off-the-shelf models and generate insights tailored to local datasets and specific classification tasks and target variables. Our tool combines a simple command-line interface for preprocessing, training, and evaluation with a graphical interface for annotation, error analysis, and model comparison. This design enables ecologists to build and iterate on compact, task-specific classifiers without requiring advanced ML expertise. As a proof of concept, we apply the pipeline to classify red deer (Cervus elaphus) by age and sex from 3392 camera trap images collected in the Veldenstein Forest, Germany. Using 4352 cropped images containing individual deer labeled by experts, we trained and evaluated multiple backbone architectures with a wide variety of parameters and data augmentation strategies. Our best-performing models achieved 90.77% accuracy for age classification and 96.15% for sex classification. These results demonstrate that reliable demographic classification is feasible even with limited data to answer narrow, well-defined ecological problems. More broadly, the framework provides ecologists with an accessible tool for developing ML models tailored to specific research questions, paving the way for broader adoption of ML in wildlife monitoring and demographic analysis.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLM) benchmarks tell us when models fail, but not why they fail. A wrong answer on a reasoning dataset may stem from formatting issues, calculation errors, or dataset noise rather than weak reasoning. Without disentangling such causes, benchmarks remain incomplete and cannot reliably guide model improvement. We introduce ErrorMap, the first method to chart the sources of LLM failure. It extracts a model's unique \"failure signature\", clarifies what benchmarks measure, and broadens error identification to reduce blind spots. This helps developers debug models, aligns benchmark goals with outcomes, and supports informed model selection. ErrorMap works on any model or dataset with the same logic. Applying our method to 35 datasets and 83 models we generate ErrorAtlas, a taxonomy of model errors, revealing recurring failure patterns. ErrorAtlas highlights error types that are currently underexplored in LLM research, such as omissions of required details in the output and question misinterpretation. By shifting focus from where models succeed to why they fail, ErrorMap and ErrorAtlas enable advanced evaluation - one that exposes hidden weaknesses and directs progress. Unlike success, typically measured by task-level metrics, our approach introduces a deeper evaluation layer that can be applied globally across models and tasks, offering richer insights into model behavior and limitations. We make the taxonomy and code publicly available with plans to periodically update ErrorAtlas as new benchmarks and models emerge.",

    "abstract": "A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a deep learning algorithm that has been specifically designed for computer vision applications. The CNNs proved successful in handling the increasing amount of data in many computer vision problems, where classical machine learning algorithms were insufficient. Flowers have many uses in our daily lives, from decorating to making medicines to detoxifying the environment. Identifying flower types requires expert knowledge. However, accessing experts at any time and in any location may not always be feasible. In this study a mobile application based on CNNs was developed to recognize different types of flowers to provide non-specialists with quick and easy access to information about flower types. The study employed three distinct CNN models, namely MobileNet, DenseNet121, and Xception, to determine the most suitable model for the mobile application. The classification performances of the models were evaluated by training them with seven different optimization algorithms. The DenseNet-121 architecture, which uses the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm, was the most successful, achieving 95.84 % accuracy, 96.00% precision, recall, and F1-score. This result shows that CNNs can be used for flower classification in mobile applications.",

    "abstract": "An increasing body of work has leveraged multilingual language models for Natural Language Generation tasks such as summarization. A major empirical bottleneck in this area is the shortage of accurate and robust evaluation metrics for many languages, which hinders progress. Recent studies suggest that multilingual language models often use English as an internal pivot language, and that misalignment with this pivot can lead to degraded downstream performance. Motivated by the hypothesis that this mismatch could also apply to multilingual neural metrics, we ask whether steering their activations toward an English pivot can improve correlation with human judgments. We experiment with encoder- and decoder-based metrics and find that test-time intervention methods are effective across the board, increasing metric effectiveness for diverse languages.",

    "title": "Inference-Time Scaling of Verification: Self-Evolving Deep Research Agents via Test-Time Rubric-Guided Verification",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in Deep Research Agents (DRAs) are transforming automated knowledge discovery and problem-solving. While the majority of existing efforts focus on enhancing policy capabilities via post-training, we propose an alternative paradigm: self-evolving the agent's ability by iteratively verifying the policy model's outputs, guided by meticulously crafted rubrics. This approach gives rise to the inference-time scaling of verification, wherein an agent self-improves by evaluating its generated answers to produce iterative feedback and refinements. We derive the rubrics based on an automatically constructed DRA Failure Taxonomy, which systematically classifies agent failures into five major categories and thirteen sub-categories. We present DeepVerifier, a rubrics-based outcome reward verifier that leverages the asymmetry of verification and outperforms vanilla agent-as-judge and LLM judge baselines by 12%-48% in meta-evaluation F1 score. To enable practical self-evolution, DeepVerifier integrates as a plug-and-play module during test-time inference. The verifier produces detailed rubric-based feedback, which is fed back to the agent for iterative bootstrapping, refining responses without additional training. This test-time scaling delivers 8%-11% accuracy gains on challenging subsets of GAIA and XBench-DeepResearch when powered by capable closed-source LLMs. Finally, to support open-source advancement, we release DeepVerifier-4K, a curated supervised fine-tuning dataset of 4,646 high-quality agent steps focused on DRA verification. These examples emphasize reflection and self-critique, enabling open models to develop robust verification capabilities.",

Yet realizing this potential symbiotically -- where biological and digital agents co-adapt and co-process -- remains elusive, largely due to the absence of a shared vocabulary bridging biology and computing. Consequently, microbes are often constrained to uni-directional roles, functioning as sensors or actuators rather than as active, computational partners in bio-digital systems. In response, we propose a taxonomy and pathways that articulate and expand the roles of biological and digital entities for synergetic bio-digital computation. Using this taxonomy, we analysed 70 systems across HCI, design, and engineering, identifying how biological mechanisms can be mapped onto computational abstractions. We argue that such mappings enable computationally actionable directions that foster richer and reciprocal relationships in bio-digital systems, supporting regenerative ecologies across time and scale while inspiring new paradigms for computation in HCI.",

Such operations are critical when surface access is not possible and stealthy navigation is required in restricted environments such as protected zones or dangerous areas under access ban. GNSS denied navigation is then essential to maintaining concealment as surfacing could expose UUVs to detection. To ensure a precise fleet positioning a constellation of beacons deployed by aerial or surface drones establish a synthetic landmark network that will guide the fleet of UUVs along an optimized path from the continental shelf to the goal on the shore. These beacons either submerged or floating emit acoustic signals for UUV localisation and navigation. A hierarchical planner generates an adaptive route for the drones executing primitive actions while continuously monitoring and replanning as needed to maintain trajectory accuracy.",

    "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to mitigate risks, their safety guardrails remain fragile against jailbreak attacks. This reveals limited understanding of components governing safety. Existing methods rely on local, greedy attribution that assumes independent component contributions. However, they overlook the cooperative interactions between different components in LLMs, such as attention heads, which jointly contribute to safety mechanisms. We propose \\textbf{G}lobal \\textbf{O}ptimization for \\textbf{S}afety \\textbf{V}ector Extraction (GOSV), a framework that identifies safety-critical attention heads through global optimization over all heads simultaneously. We employ two complementary activation repatching strategies: Harmful Patching and Zero Ablation. These strategies identify two spatially distinct sets of safety vectors with consistently low overlap, termed Malicious Injection Vectors and Safety Suppression Vectors, demonstrating that aligned LLMs maintain separate functional pathways for safety purposes. Through systematic analyses, we find that complete safety breakdown occurs when approximately 30\\% of total heads are repatched across all models. Building on these insights, we develop a novel inference-time white-box jailbreak method that exploits the identified safety vectors through activation repatching. Our attack substantially outperforms existing white-box attacks across all test models, providing strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed GOSV framework on LLM safety interpretability.",

    "abstract": "Many theorists of creativity maintain that intentional agency is a necessary condition of creativity. We argue that this requirement, which we call the Intentional Agency Condition (IAC), should be rejected as a general condition of creativity, while retaining its relevance in specific contexts. We show that recent advances in generative AI have rendered the IAC increasingly problematic, both descriptively and functionally. We offer two reasons for abandoning it at the general level. First, we present corpus evidence indicating that authors and journalists are increasingly comfortable ascribing creativity to generative AI, despite its lack of intentional agency. This development places pressure on the linguistic intuitions that have traditionally been taken to support the IAC. Second, drawing on the method of conceptual engineering, we argue that the IAC no longer fulfils its core social function. Rather than facilitating the identification and encouragement of reliable sources of novel and valuable products, it now feeds into biases that distort our assessments of AI-generated outputs. We therefore propose replacing the IAC with a consistency requirement, according to which creativity tracks the reliable generation of novel and valuable products. Nonetheless, we explain why the IAC should be retained in specific local domains.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) in objective tasks like mathematics and coding, there is growing interest in their potential to simulate human behavior--a capability with profound implications for transforming social science research and customer-centric business insights. However, LLMs often lack a nuanced understanding of human cognition and behavior, limiting their effectiveness in social simulation and personalized applications. We posit that this limitation stems from a fundamental misalignment: standard LLM pretraining on vast, uncontextualized web data does not capture the continuous, situated context of an individual's decisions, thoughts, and behaviors over time. To bridge this gap, we introduce HumanLLM, a foundation model designed for personalized understanding and simulation of individuals. We first construct the Cognitive Genome Dataset, a large-scale corpus curated from real-world user data on platforms like Reddit, Twitter, Blogger, and Amazon. Through a rigorous, multi-stage pipeline involving data filtering, synthesis, and quality control, we automatically extract over 5.5 million user logs to distill rich profiles, behaviors, and thinking patterns. We then formulate diverse learning tasks and perform supervised fine-tuning to empower the model to predict a wide range of individualized human behaviors, thoughts, and experiences. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that HumanLLM achieves superior performance in predicting user actions and inner thoughts, more accurately mimics user writing styles and preferences, and generates more authentic user profiles compared to base models. Furthermore, HumanLLM shows significant gains on out-of-domain social intelligence benchmarks, indicating enhanced generalization.",

    "abstract": "The quantum Hamiltonian is a fundamental property that governs a molecule's electronic structure and behavior, and its calculation and prediction are paramount in computational chemistry and materials science. Accurate prediction is highly reliant on extensive training data, including precise molecular geometries and the Hamiltonian matrices, which are expensive to acquire via either experimental or computational methods. Towards a fast yet accurate method for Hamiltonian prediction, we first introduce a geometry information-aware molecular language model to bypass the use of expensive molecular geometries by only using the readily available molecular language -- simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES). Our method employs multimodal alignment to bridge the relationship between SMILES strings and their corresponding molecular geometries. Recognizing that the molecular language inherently lacks explicit geometric information, we propose a geometry modality compensation strategy to imbue molecular language representations with essential geometric features, thereby enabling accurate predictions using SMILES. In addition, given the high cost of acquiring Hamiltonian data, we devise a weakly supervised strategy to fine-tune the molecular language model, thus improving the data efficiency. Theoretically, we prove that the prediction generalization error without explicit molecular geometry can be bounded through our modality compensation scheme. Empirically, our method achieves superior computational efficiency, providing up to 100x speedup over conventional quantum mechanical methods while maintaining comparable prediction accuracy. We further demonstrate the practical case study of our approach in the screening of electrolyte formulations.",

We introduce a synthetic benchmark that probes two complementary skills: situational awareness (recognizing whether an interaction is harmful or benign) and spatial awareness (tracking who does what to whom, and reasoning about relative positions and motion). Through minimal video pairs, we test three challenges: distinguishing violence from benign activity, binding assailant roles across viewpoints, and judging fine-grained trajectory alignment. While we evaluate recent VLMs in a training-free setting, the benchmark is applicable to any video classification model. Results show performance only slightly above chance across tasks. A simple aid, stable color cues, partly reduces assailant role confusions but does not resolve the underlying weakness.

Traditional methods augment the training set through geometric and photometric transformations; however, the generated samples remain highly correlated with the original images and lack structural diversity. To address this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based data augmentation framework capable of generating diverse and structurally plausible image-label pairs for neuron segmentation. Specifically, the framework employs a resolution-aware conditional diffusion model with multi-scale conditioning and EM resolution priors to enable voxel-level image synthesis from 3D masks. It further incorporates a biology-guided mask remodeling module that produces augmented masks with enhanced structural realism. Together, these components effectively enrich the training set and improve segmentation performance.

To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, the problem of Agentic Confidence Calibration and propose Holistic Trajectory Calibration (HTC), a novel diagnostic framework that extracts rich process-level features ranging from macro dynamics to micro stability across an agent's entire trajectory. Powered by a simple, interpretable model, HTC consistently surpasses strong baselines in both calibration and discrimination, across eight benchmarks, multiple LLMs, and diverse agent frameworks. Beyond performance, HTC delivers three essential advances: it provides interpretability by revealing the signals behind failure, enables transferability by applying across domains without retraining, and achieves generalization through a General Agent Calibrator (GAC) that achieves the best calibration (lowest ECE) on the out-of-domain GAIA benchmark. Together, these contributions establish a new process-centric paradigm for confidence calibration, providing a framework for diagnosing and enhancing the reliability of AI agents.",

To promote safer and more predictable interaction in dynamic flight, Glove2UAV is designed as a lightweight and easily deployable wearable interface intended for real-time operation. Glove2UAV streams inertial measurements in real time and estimates palm and finger orientations using a compact processing pipeline that combines median-based outlier suppression with Madgwick-based orientation estimation. The resulting motion estimations are mapped to a small set of control primitives for directional flight (forward/backward and lateral motion) and, when supported by the platform, to object-interaction commands. Vibrotactile feedback is triggered when flight speed exceeds predefined threshold values, providing an additional alert channel during operation. We validate real-time feasibility by synchronizing glove signals with UAV telemetry in both simulation and real-world flights. The results show fast gesture-based command execution, stable coupling between gesture dynamics and platform motion, correct operation of the core command set in our trials, and timely delivery of vibratile warning cues.",

However, understanding and evaluating improvements by deriving metrics such as code coverage and unique crashes are problematic, leading to a desire for a reliable bug-based benchmark. To address the need, we design and build FirmReBugger, a holistic framework for fairly assessing monolithic firmware fuzzers with a realistic, diverse, bug-based benchmark. FirmReBugger proposes using bug oracles--C syntax expressions of bug descriptors--with an interpreter to automate analysis and accurately report on bugs discovered, discriminating between states of detected, triggered, reached and not reached. Importantly, our idea of benchmarking does not modify the target binary and simply replays fuzzing seeds to isolate the benchmark implementation from the fuzzer while providing a simple means to extend with new bug oracles. Further, analyzing fuzzing roadblocks, we created FirmBench, a set of diverse, real-world binary targets with 313 software bug oracles. Incorporating our analysis of roadblocks challenging monolithic firmware fuzzing, the bench provides for rapid evaluation of future advances. We implement FirmReBugger in a FuzzBench-for-Firmware type service and use FirmBench to evaluate 9 state-of-the art monolithic firmware fuzzers in the style of a reproducibility study, using a 10 CPU-year effort, to report our findings.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement and strong generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs), they have been increasingly incorporated into the active learning pipelines as annotators to reduce annotation costs. However, considering the annotation quality, labels generated by LLMs often fall short of real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a novel active learning framework, Mixture of LLMs in the Loop Active Learning, replacing human annotators with labels generated through a Mixture-of-LLMs-based annotation model, aimed at enhancing LLM-based annotation robustness by aggregating the strengths of multiple LLMs. To further mitigate the impact of the noisy labels, we introduce annotation discrepancy and negative learning to identify the unreliable annotations and enhance learning effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves performance comparable to human annotation and consistently outperforms single-LLM baselines and other LLM-ensemble-based approaches. Moreover, our framework is built on lightweight LLMs, enabling it to operate fully on local machines in real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is an emerging explicit scene representation method with significant potential for image compression due to high fidelity and high compression ratios. However, existing low-light enhancement algorithms operate predominantly within the pixel domain. Processing 2DGS-compressed images necessitates a cumbersome decompression-enhancement-recompression pipeline, which compromises efficiency and introduces secondary degradation. To address these limitations, we propose LL-GaussianImage, the first zero-shot unsupervised framework designed for low-light enhancement directly within the 2DGS compressed representation domain. Three primary advantages are offered by this framework. First, a semantic-guided Mixture-of-Experts enhancement framework is designed. Dynamic adaptive transformations are applied to the sparse attribute space of 2DGS using rendered images as guidance to enable compression-as-enhancement without full decompression to a pixel grid. Second, a multi-objective collaborative loss function system is established to strictly constrain smoothness and fidelity during enhancement, suppressing artifacts while improving visual quality. Third, a two-stage optimization process is utilized to achieve reconstruction-as-enhancement. The accuracy of the base representation is ensured through single-scale reconstruction and network robustness is enhanced. High-quality enhancement of low-light images is achieved while high compression ratios are maintained. The feasibility and superiority of the paradigm for direct processing within the compressed representation domain are validated through experimental results.",

    "abstract": "Drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction is central to drug discovery and clinical development, particularly in the context of increasingly prevalent polypharmacy. Although existing computational methods achieve strong performance on standard benchmarks, they often fail to generalize to realistic deployment scenarios, where most candidate drug pairs involve previously unseen drugs and validated interactions are scarce. We demonstrate that proximity in the embedding spaces of prevailing molecule-centric DDI models does not reliably correspond to interaction labels, and that simply scaling up model capacity therefore fails to improve generalization. To address these limitations, we propose GenRel-DDI, a generalizable relation learning framework that reformulates DDI prediction as a relation-centric learning problem, in which interaction representations are learned independently of drug identities. This relation-level abstraction enables the capture of transferable interaction patterns that generalize to unseen drugs and novel drug pairs. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark demonstrate that GenRel-DDI consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with particularly large gains on strict entity-disjoint evaluations, highlighting the effectiveness and practical utility of relation learning for robust DDI prediction.

In this work, we introduce Recursive Flow (RC-Flow), a novel solver that leverages pre-trained flow matching priors to robustly recover channel state information from noisy, under-determined measurements. Different from conventional open-loop generative models, our approach establishes a closed-loop refinement framework via a serial restart mechanism and anchored trajectory rectification. By synergizing flow-consistent prior directions with data-fidelity proximal projections, the proposed RC-Flow achieves robust channel reconstruction and delivers state-of-the-art performance across diverse noise levels, particularly in noise-dominated scenarios. The framework is further augmented by an adaptive dual-scheduling strategy, offering flexible management of the trade-off between convergence speed and reconstruction accuracy. Theoretically, we analyze the Jacobian spectral radius of the recursive operator to prove its global asymptotic stability. Numerical results demonstrate that RC-Flow reduces inference latency by two orders of magnitude while achieving a 2.7 dB performance gain in low signal-to-noise ratio regimes compared to the score-based baseline.",

    "abstract": "Significant progress has been made in low-light image enhancement with respect to visual quality. However, most existing methods primarily operate in the pixel domain or rely on implicit feature representations. As a result, the intrinsic geometric structural priors of images are often neglected. 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has emerged as a prominent explicit scene representation technique characterized by superior structural fitting capabilities and high rendering efficiency. Despite these advantages, the utilization of 2DGS in low-level vision tasks remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, LL-GaussianMap is proposed as the first unsupervised framework incorporating 2DGS into low-light image enhancement. Distinct from conventional methodologies, the enhancement task is formulated as a gain map generation process guided by 2DGS primitives. The proposed method comprises two primary stages. First, high-fidelity structural reconstruction is executed utilizing 2DGS. Then, data-driven enhancement dictionary coefficients are rendered via the rasterization mechanism of Gaussian splatting through an innovative unified enhancement module. This design effectively incorporates the structural perception capabilities of 2DGS into gain map generation, thereby preserving edges and suppressing artifacts during enhancement. Additionally, the reliance on paired data is circumvented through unsupervised learning. Experimental results demonstrate that LL-GaussianMap achieves superior enhancement performance with an extremely low storage footprint, highlighting the effectiveness of explicit Gaussian representations for image enhancement.",

To address these challenges, we introduce \\textbf{NMRGym}, the largest and most comprehensive standardized dataset and benchmark derived from high-quality experimental NMR data to date.

Additionally, we provide fine-grained peak-atom level annotations to support future usage. Leveraging this resource, we establish a comprehensive evaluation suite covering diverse downstream tasks, including structure elucidation, functional group prediction from NMR, toxicity prediction from NMR, and spectral simulation, benchmarking representative state-of-the-art methodologies.

As a result, a low-cost real-world RL method with minimal data requirements has yet to emerge. We introduce \\textbf{SigEnt-SAC}, an off-policy actor-critic method that learns from scratch using a single expert trajectory. Our key design is a sigmoid-bounded entropy term that prevents negative-entropy-driven optimization toward out-of-distribution actions and reduces Q-function oscillations. We benchmark SigEnt-SAC on D4RL tasks against representative baselines. Experiments show that SigEnt-SAC substantially alleviates Q-function oscillations and reaches a 100\\% success rate faster than prior methods. Finally, we validate SigEnt-SAC on four real-world robotic tasks across multiple embodiments, where agents learn from raw images and sparse rewards; results demonstrate that SigEnt-SAC can learn successful policies with only a small number of real-world interactions, suggesting a low-cost and practical pathway for real-world RL deployment.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents FeTal-SAM, a novel adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) tailored for fetal brain MRI segmentation. Traditional deep learning methods often require large annotated datasets for a fixed set of labels, making them inflexible when clinical or research needs change. By integrating atlas-based prompts and foundation-model principles, FeTal-SAM addresses two key limitations in fetal brain MRI segmentation: (1) the need to retrain models for varying label definitions, and (2) the lack of insight into whether segmentations are driven by genuine image contrast or by learned spatial priors. We leverage multi-atlas registration to generate spatially aligned label templates that serve as dense prompts, alongside a bounding-box prompt, for SAM's segmentation decoder. This strategy enables binary segmentation on a per-structure basis, which is subsequently fused to reconstruct the full 3D segmentation volumes. Evaluations on two datasets, the dHCP dataset and an in-house dataset demonstrate FeTal-SAM's robust performance across gestational ages. Notably, it achieves Dice scores comparable to state-of-the-art baselines which were trained for each dataset and label definition for well-contrasted structures like cortical plate and cerebellum, while maintaining the flexibility to segment any user-specified anatomy. Although slightly lower accuracy is observed for subtle, low-contrast structures (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala), our results highlight FeTal-SAM's potential to serve as a general-purpose segmentation model without exhaustive retraining. This method thus constitutes a promising step toward clinically adaptable fetal brain MRI analysis tools.",

We present physical spectrum-aware white-box mHC, named ES-mHC, a hyper-connection framework that explicitly models interactions among different electromagnetic spectrum groupings (residual stream in mHC) interactions using structured, directional matrices. By separating feature representation from interaction structure, ES-mHC promotes electromagnetic spectrum grouping specialization, reduces redundancy, and exposes internal information flow that can be directly visualized and spatially analyzed. Using hyperspectral image classification as a representative testbed, we demonstrate that the learned hyper-connection matrices exhibit coherent spatial patterns and asymmetric interaction behaviors, providing mechanistic insight into the model internal dynamics. Furthermore, we find that increasing the expansion rate accelerates the emergence of structured interaction patterns. These results suggest that ES-mHC transforms HSIC from a purely black-box prediction task into a structurally transparent, partially white-box learning process.",

Existing work focuses predominantly on aligning marginal response distributions, treating each survey item independently. While essential, this may overlook deeper latent structures that characterise real populations and underpin cultural values theories. We propose a framework for evaluating the representativeness of aligned models through multivariate correlation patterns in addition to marginal distributions. We show the value of our evaluation scheme by comparing two model steering techniques (persona prompting and demographic fine-tuning) and evaluating them against human responses from the World Values Survey. While the demographically fine-tuned model better approximates marginal response distributions than persona prompting, both techniques fail to fully capture the gold standard correlation patterns. We conclude that representativeness is a distinct aspect of value alignment and an evaluation focused on marginals can mask structural failures, leading to overly optimistic conclusions about model capabilities.",

    "abstract": "High-dimensional malware datasets often exhibit feature redundancy, instability, and scalability limitations, which hinder the effectiveness and interpretability of machine learning-based malware detection systems. Although feature selection is commonly employed to mitigate these issues, many existing approaches lack robustness when applied to large-scale and heterogeneous malware data. To address this gap, this paper proposes CAFE-GB (Chunk-wise Aggregated Feature Estimation using Gradient Boosting), a scalable feature selection framework designed to produce stable and globally consistent feature rankings for high-dimensional malware detection. CAFE-GB partitions training data into overlapping chunks, estimates local feature importance using gradient boosting models, and aggregates these estimates to derive a robust global ranking. Feature budget selection is performed separately through a systematic k-selection and stability analysis to balance detection performance and robustness. The proposed framework is evaluated on two large-scale malware datasets: BODMAS and CIC-AndMal2020, representing large and diverse malware feature spaces. Experimental results show that classifiers trained on CAFE-GB -selected features achieve performance parity with full-feature baselines across multiple metrics, including Accuracy, F1-score, MCC, ROC-AUC, and PR-AUC, while reducing feature dimensionality by more than 95\\%. Paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests confirm that this reduction does not introduce statistically significant performance degradation. Additional analyses demonstrate low inter-feature redundancy and improved interpretability through SHAP-based explanations. Runtime and memory profiling further indicate reduced downstream classification overhead. Overall, CAFE-GB provides a stable, interpretable, and scalable feature selection strategy for large-scale malware detection.",

In this paper, we introduce a new task, Tabular Incremental Inference (TabII), which aims to enable trained models to incorporate new columns during the inference stage, enhancing the practicality of AI models in scenarios where tables are dynamically changed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this new task can be framed as an optimization problem based on the information bottleneck theory, which emphasizes that the key to an ideal tabular incremental inference approach lies in minimizing mutual information between tabular data and representation while maximizing between representation and task labels. Under this guidance, we design a TabII method with Large Language Model placeholders and Pretrained TabAdapter to provide external knowledge and Incremental Sample Condensation blocks to condense the task-relevant information given by incremental column attributes.

Subsequently, we employ fine-grained rewards to guide these models in generating highly supportive and clinically relevant descriptions, ensuring the alignment of model's outputs with desired behaviors. Experimental results on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating hallucinations and enhancing report quality.",

    "title": "Breaking the Resolution Barrier: Arbitrary-resolution Deep Image Steganography Framework",
    "abstract": "Deep image steganography (DIS) has achieved significant results in capacity and invisibility. However, current paradigms enforce the secret image to maintain the same resolution as the cover image during hiding and revealing. This leads to two challenges: secret images with inconsistent resolutions must undergo resampling beforehand which results in detail loss during recovery, and the secret image cannot be recovered to its original resolution when the resolution value is unknown. To address these, we propose ARDIS, the first Arbitrary Resolution DIS framework, which shifts the paradigm from discrete mapping to reference-guided continuous signal reconstruction. Specifically, to minimize the detail loss caused by resolution mismatch, we first design a Frequency Decoupling Architecture in hiding stage. It disentangles the secret into a resolution-aligned global basis and a resolution-agnostic high-frequency latent to hide in a fixed-resolution cover. Second, for recovery, we propose a Latent-Guided Implicit Reconstructor to perform deterministic restoration. The recovered detail latent code modulates a continuous implicit function to accurately query and render high-frequency residuals onto the recovered global basis, ensuring faithful restoration of original details. Furthermore, to achieve blind recovery, we introduce an Implicit Resolution Coding strategy. By transforming discrete resolution values into dense feature maps and hiding them in the redundant space of the feature domain, the reconstructor can correctly decode the secret's resolution directly from the steganographic representation. Experimental results demonstrate that ARDIS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both invisibility and cross-resolution recovery fidelity.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic multi-product delivery environments demand rapid coordination of part completion and product-level kitting within hybrid processing and assembly systems to satisfy strict hierarchical supply constraints. The flexible assembly flow shop scheduling problem formally defines dependencies for multi-stage kitting, yet dynamic variants make designing integrated scheduling rules under multi-level time coupling highly challenging. Existing automated heuristic design methods, particularly genetic programming constrained to fixed terminal symbol sets, struggle to capture and leverage dynamic uncertainties and hierarchical dependency information under transient decision states. This study develops an LLM-assisted Dynamic Rule Design framework (LLM4DRD) that automatically evolves integrated online scheduling rules adapted to scheduling features. Firstly, multi-stage processing and assembly supply decisions are transformed into feasible directed edge orderings based on heterogeneous graph. Then, an elite knowledge guided initialization embeds advanced design expertise into initial rules to enhance initial quality. Additionally, a dual-expert mechanism is introduced in which LLM-A evolutionary code to generate candidate rules and LLM-S conducts scheduling evaluation, while dynamic feature-fitting rule evolution combined with hybrid evaluation enables continuous improvement and extracts adaptive rules with strong generalization capability. A series of experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the method. The average tardiness of LLM4DRD is 3.17-12.39% higher than state-of-the-art methods in 20 practical instances used for training and testing, respectively. In 24 scenarios with different resource configurations, order loads, and disturbance levels totaling 480 instances, it achieves 11.10% higher performance than the second best competitor, exhibiting excellent robustness.",

Recent advancements in the field provide foundation models and sophisticated agentic systems pushing the boundaries of formal mathematical reasoning to approach the natural language capability of LLMs. However, little attention has been given to the formal physics reasoning, which also heavily relies on similar problem-solving and theorem-proving frameworks. To solve this problem, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to enhance formal theorem proving in the physics domain. We compose a dedicated dataset PhysLeanData for the task. It is composed of theorems sampled from PhysLean and data generated by a conjecture-based formal data generation pipeline. In the training pipeline, we leverage DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B, a strong open-source mathematical theorem prover, and apply Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to train our model PhysProver. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that, using only $\\sim$5K training samples, PhysProver achieves an overall 2.4\\% improvement in multiple sub-domains. Furthermore, after formal physics training, we observe 1.3\\% gains on the MiniF2F-Test benchmark, which indicates non-trivial generalization beyond physics domains and enhancement for formal math capability as well. The results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, which provides a paradigm for extending formal provers outside mathematical domains.

Existing models often struggle to effectively fuse information from multiple sources and adapt to the heterogeneous nature of pathological tissues. To address this, we introduce a novel framework for adapting foundation models to multi-modal medical imaging, featuring two key technical innovations: sub-region-aware modality attention and adaptive prompt engineering. The attention mechanism enables the model to learn the optimal combination of modalities for each tumor sub-region, while the adaptive prompting strategy leverages the inherent capabilities of foundation models to refine segmentation accuracy. We validate our framework on the BraTS 2020 brain tumor segmentation dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods, particularly in the challenging necrotic core sub-region. Our work provides a principled and effective approach to multi-modal fusion and prompting, paving the way for more accurate and robust foundation model-based solutions in medical imaging.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful approach for multimodal motion planning in autonomous driving. However, their practical deployment is typically hindered by the inherent difficulty in enforcing vehicle dynamics and a critical reliance on accurate predictions of other agents, making them prone to safety issues under uncertain interactions. To address these limitations, we introduce DualShield, a planning and control framework that leverages Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability value functions in a dual capacity. First, the value functions act as proactive guidance, steering the diffusion denoising process towards safe and dynamically feasible regions. Second, they form a reactive safety shield using control barrier-value functions (CBVFs) to modify the executed actions and ensure safety. This dual mechanism preserves the rich exploration capabilities of diffusion models while providing principled safety assurance under uncertain and even adversarial interactions. Simulations in challenging unprotected U-turn scenarios demonstrate that DualShield significantly improves both safety and task efficiency compared to leading methods from different planning paradigms under uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "While Text-to-SQL remains the dominant approach for database interaction, real-world analytics increasingly require the flexibility of general-purpose programming languages such as Python or Pandas to manage file-based data and complex analytical workflows. Despite this growing need, the reliability of Text-to-Python in core data retrieval remains underexplored relative to the mature SQL ecosystem. To address this gap, we introduce BIRD-Python, a benchmark designed for cross-paradigm evaluation. We systematically refined the original dataset to reduce annotation noise and align execution semantics, thereby establishing a consistent and standardized baseline for comparison. Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigmatic divergence: whereas SQL leverages implicit DBMS behaviors through its declarative structure, Python requires explicit procedural logic, making it highly sensitive to underspecified user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose the Logic Completion Framework (LCF), which resolves ambiguity by incorporating latent domain knowledge into the generation process. Experimental results show that (1) performance differences primarily stem from missing domain context rather than inherent limitations in code generation, and (2) when these gaps are addressed, Text-to-Python achieves performance parity with Text-to-SQL. These findings establish Python as a viable foundation for analytical agents-provided that systems effectively ground ambiguous natural language inputs in executable logical specifications.

    "abstract": "The performance of modern AI systems is fundamentally constrained by the quality of their underlying kernels, which translate high-level algorithmic semantics into low-level hardware operations. Achieving near-optimal kernels requires expert-level understanding of hardware architectures and programming models, making kernel engineering a critical but notoriously time-consuming and non-scalable process. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have opened new possibilities for automating kernel generation and optimization. LLMs are well-suited to compress expert-level kernel knowledge that is difficult to formalize, while agentic systems further enable scalable optimization by casting kernel development as an iterative, feedback-driven loop. Rapid progress has been made in this area. However, the field remains fragmented, lacking a systematic perspective for LLM-driven kernel generation. This survey addresses this gap by providing a structured overview of existing approaches, spanning LLM-based approaches and agentic optimization workflows, and systematically compiling the datasets and benchmarks that underpin learning and evaluation in this domain. Moreover, key open challenges and future research directions are further outlined, aiming to establish a comprehensive reference for the next generation of automated kernel optimization.

    "abstract": "Now-a-days, Online Social Networks (OSNs) are extensively used by different commercial houses for viral marketing. The key problem that arises in this context is to choose a limited number of highly influential users as the initial adopters of a brand such that the influence regarding the brand in the network gets maximized. Deviating from this standard setting, in this paper, we study the problem where every user of the network is associated with a selection cost and a benefit value. This benefit value can be earned from the user if (s)he is influenced by the brand. A fixed amount of budget is allocated for selecting the seed users. The goal of initial adopters is to choose a set of seed users within the budget such that the profit is maximized. We propose a two phase diffusion model for this problem where the goal is to split the diffusion process into two phases, and hence, split the budget into two halves. First, we spend the first half budget to select seed users for the first phase and observe the diffusion for a few rounds and then deploy the seed users for the second phase and successively complete the diffusion process. We prove several properties of the two phase influence function. Three solution approaches have been proposed for our problem with detailed analysis and illustrative examples. We conduct a number of experiments with three real-world social network datasets. From the experiments, we observe that the two phase diffusion approach leads to more amount of profit compared to the single-phase diffusion. In particular, for most instances, this improvement is greater than 18% and reaching as high as 40% by the proposed methodologies.",

    "abstract": "Long-form video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for current Video Large Language Models. Most existing models rely on static reasoning over uniformly sampled frames, which weakens temporal localization and leads to substantial information loss in long videos. Agentic tools such as temporal retrieval, spatial zoom, and temporal zoom offer a natural way to overcome these limitations by enabling adaptive exploration of key moments. However, constructing agentic video understanding data requires models that already possess strong long-form video comprehension, creating a circular dependency. We address this challenge with VideoThinker, an agentic Video Large Language Model trained entirely on synthetic tool interaction trajectories. Our key idea is to convert videos into rich captions and employ a powerful agentic language model to generate multi-step tool use sequences in caption space. These trajectories are subsequently grounded back to video by replacing captions with the corresponding frames, yielding a large-scale interleaved video and tool reasoning dataset without requiring any long-form understanding from the underlying model. Training on this synthetic agentic dataset equips VideoThinker with dynamic reasoning capabilities, adaptive temporal exploration, and multi-step tool use. Remarkably, VideoThinker significantly outperforms both caption-only language model agents and strong video model baselines across long-video benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of tool augmented synthetic data and adaptive retrieval and zoom reasoning for long-form video understanding.",

Unifying frameworks for information inequalities arising from submodularity were developed by Madiman and Tetali (2010) and Sason (2022). Madiman and Tetali (2010) established strong and weak fractional inequalities that subsume classical results such as Han's inequality and Shearer's lemma. Sason (2022) introduced a convex-functional framework for generalizing Han's inequality, and derived unified inequalities for submodular and supermodular functions. In this work, we build on these frameworks and make three contributions. First, we establish convex-functional generalizations of the strong and weak Madiman and Tetali inequalities for submodular functions. Second, using a special case of the strong Madiman-Tetali inequality, we derive a new Loomis-Whitney-type projection inequality for finite point sets in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, which improves upon the classical Loomis-Whitney bound by incorporating slice-level structural information. Finally, we study an extremal graph theory problem that recovers and extends the previously known results of Sason (2022) and Boucheron et al., employing Shearer's lemma in contrast to the use of Han's inequality in those works.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) unlock new ways of learning from graph-structured data, proving highly effective in capturing complex relationships and patterns. Federated GNNs (FGNNs) have emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm for training GNNs over decentralized data. However, FGNNs face two significant challenges: high communication overhead from multiple rounds of parameter exchanges and non-IID data characteristics across clients. To address these issues, we introduce CeFGC, a novel FGNN paradigm that facilitates efficient GNN training over non-IID data by limiting communication between the server and clients to three rounds only. The core idea of CeFGC is to leverage generative diffusion models to minimize direct client-server communication. Each client trains a generative diffusion model that captures its local graph distribution and shares this model with the server, which then redistributes it back to all clients. Using these generative models, clients generate synthetic graphs combined with their local graphs to train local GNN models. Finally, clients upload their model weights to the server for aggregation into a global GNN model. We theoretically analyze the I/O complexity of communication volume to show that CeFGC reduces to a constant of three communication rounds only. Extensive experiments on several real graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CeFGC against state-of-the-art competitors, reflecting our superior performance on non-IID graphs by aligning local and global model objectives and enriching the training set with diverse graphs.",

    "abstract": "Understanding what users like is relatively straightforward; understanding what users dislike, however, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. Research into users' negative preferences has gained increasing importance in modern recommendation systems. Numerous platforms have introduced explicit negative feedback mechanisms and leverage such signals to refine their recommendation models. Beyond traditional business metrics, user experience-driven metrics, such as negative feedback rates, have become critical indicators for evaluating system performance. However, most existing approaches primarily use negative feedback as an auxiliary signal to enhance positive recommendations, paying little attention to directly modeling negative interests, which can be highly valuable in offline applications. Moreover, due to the inherent sparsity of negative feedback data, models often suffer from context understanding biases induced by positive feedback dominance. To address these challenges, we propose the first large language model framework for negative feedback modeling with special designed context-discerning modules. We use semantic ID Representation to replace text-based item descriptions and introduce an item-level alignment task that enhances the LLM's understanding of the semantic context behind negative feedback. Furthermore, we design a Progressive GRPO training paradigm that enables the model to dynamically balance the positive and negative behavioral context utilization. Besides, our investigation further reveals a fundamental misalignment between the conventional next-negative-item prediction objective and users' true negative preferences, which is heavily influenced by the system's recommendation order. To mitigate this, we propose a novel reward function and evaluation metric grounded in multi-day future negative feedback and their collaborative signals.",

    "abstract": "An utterance-level speaker embedding is typically obtained by aggregating a sequence of frame-level representations. However, in real-world scenarios, individual frames encode not only speaker-relevant information but also various nuisance factors. As a result, different frames contribute unequally to the final utterance-level speaker representation for Automatic Speaker Verification systems. To address this issue, we propose to estimate the inherent uncertainty of each frame and assign adaptive weights accordingly, where frames with higher uncertainty receive lower attention. Based on this idea, we present U3-xi, a comprehensive framework designed to produce more reliable and interpretable uncertainty estimates for speaker embeddings. Specifically, we introduce several strategies for uncertainty supervision. First, we propose speaker-level uncertainty supervision via a Stochastic Variance Loss, where the distance between an utterance embedding and its corresponding speaker centroid serves as a pseudo ground truth for uncertainty learning. Second, we incorporate global-level uncertainty supervision by injecting the predicted uncertainty into the sof tmax scale during training. This adaptive scaling mechanism adjusts the sharpness of the decision boundary according to sample difficulty, providing global guidance. Third, we redesign the uncertainty estimation module by integrating a Transformer encoder with multi-view self-attention, enabling the model to capture rich local and long-range temporal dependencies. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that U3-xi is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly applied to various speaker encoders. In particular, when applied to ECAPA-TDNN, it achieves 21.1% and 15.57% relative improvements on the VoxCeleb1 test sets in terms of EER and minDCF, respectively.",

    "title": "Investigation of the Generalisation Ability of Genetic Programming-evolved Scheduling Rules in Dynamic Flexible Job Shop Scheduling",
    "abstract": "Dynamic Flexible Job Shop Scheduling (DFJSS) is a complex combinatorial optimisation problem that requires simultaneous machine assignment and operation sequencing decisions in dynamic production environments. Genetic Programming (GP) has been widely applied to automatically evolve scheduling rules for DFJSS. However, existing studies typically train and test GP-evolved rules on DFJSS instances of the same type, which differ only by random seeds rather than by structural characteristics, leaving their cross-type generalisation ability largely unexplored. To address this gap, this paper systematically investigates the generalisation ability of GP-evolved scheduling rules under diverse DFJSS conditions. A series of experiments are conducted across multiple dimensions, including problem scale (i.e., the number of machines and jobs), key job shop parameters (e.g., utilisation level), and data distributions, to analyse how these factors influence GP performance on unseen instance types. The results show that good generalisation occurs when the training instances contain more jobs than the test instances while keeping the number of machines fixed, and when both training and test instances have similar scales or job shop parameters. Further analysis reveals that the number and distribution of decision points in DFJSS instances play a crucial role in explaining these performance differences. Similar decision point distributions lead to better generalisation, whereas significant discrepancies result in a marked degradation of performance. Overall, this study provides new insights into the generalisation ability of GP in DFJSS and highlights the necessity of evolving more generalisable GP rules capable of handling heterogeneous DFJSS instances effectively.",

    "abstract": "Financial Generative Pre-trained Transformers (FinGPT) with multimodal capabilities are now being increasingly adopted in various financial applications. However, due to the intellectual property of model weights and the copyright of training corpus and benchmarking questions, verifying the legitimacy of GPT's model weights and the credibility of model outputs is a pressing challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel zkFinGPT scheme that applies zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to high-value financial use cases, enabling verification while protecting data privacy. We describe how zkFinGPT will be applied to three financial use cases. Our experiments on two existing packages reveal that zkFinGPT introduces substantial computational overhead that hinders its real-world adoption. E.g., for LLama3-8B model, it generates a commitment file of $7.97$MB using $531$ seconds, and takes $620$ seconds to prove and $2.36$ seconds to verify.",

    "title": "Dancing in Chains: Strategic Persuasion in Academic Rebuttal via Theory of Mind",
    "abstract": "Although artificial intelligence (AI) has become deeply integrated into various stages of the research workflow and achieved remarkable advancements, academic rebuttal remains a significant and underexplored challenge. This is because rebuttal is a complex process of strategic communication under severe information asymmetry rather than a simple technical debate. Consequently, current approaches struggle as they largely imitate surface-level linguistics, missing the essential element of perspective-taking required for effective persuasion. In this paper, we introduce RebuttalAgent, the first framework to ground academic rebuttal in Theory of Mind (ToM), operationalized through a ToM-Strategy-Response (TSR) pipeline that models reviewer mental state, formulates persuasion strategy, and generates strategy-grounded response. To train our agent, we construct RebuttalBench, a large-scale dataset synthesized via a novel critique-and-refine approach. Our training process consists of two stages, beginning with a supervised fine-tuning phase to equip the agent with ToM-based analysis and strategic planning capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning phase leveraging the self-reward mechanism for scalable self-improvement. For reliable and efficient automated evaluation, we further develop Rebuttal-RM, a specialized evaluator trained on over 100K samples of multi-source rebuttal data, which achieves scoring consistency with human preferences surpassing powerful judge GPT-4.1. Extensive experiments show RebuttalAgent significantly outperforms the base model by an average of 18.3% on automated metrics, while also outperforming advanced proprietary models across both automated and human evaluations.

    "abstract": "We propose Zero-Error Horizon (ZEH) for trustworthy LLMs, which represents the maximum range that a model can solve without any errors. While ZEH itself is simple, we demonstrate that evaluating the ZEH of state-of-the-art LLMs yields abundant insights. For example, by evaluating the ZEH of GPT-5.2, we found that GPT-5.2 cannot even compute the parity of a short string like 11000, and GPT-5.2 cannot determine whether the parentheses in ((((()))))) are balanced. This is surprising given the excellent capabilities of GPT-5.2. The fact that LLMs make mistakes on such simple problems serves as an important lesson when applying LLMs to safety-critical domains. By applying ZEH to Qwen2.5 and conducting detailed analysis, we found that while ZEH correlates with accuracy, the detailed behaviors differ, and ZEH provides clues about the emergence of algorithmic capabilities. Finally, while computing ZEH incurs significant computational cost, we discuss how to mitigate this cost by achieving up to one order of magnitude speedup using tree structures and online softmax.",

    "abstract": "Fine-grained attribute prediction is essential for fashion retail applications including catalog enrichment, visual search, and recommendation systems. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer zero-shot prediction without task-specific training, yet their systematic evaluation on multi-attribute fashion tasks remains underexplored. A key challenge is that fashion attributes are often conditional. For example, \"outer fabric\" is undefined when no outer garment is visible. This requires models to detect attribute applicability before attempting classification. We introduce a three-tier evaluation framework that decomposes this challenge: (1) overall task performance across all classes (including NA class: suggesting attribute is not applicable) for all attributes, (2) attribute applicability detection, and (3) fine-grained classification when attributes are determinable. Using DeepFashion-MultiModal, which explicitly defines NA (meaning attribute doesn't exist or is not visible) within attribute label spaces, we benchmark nine VLMs spanning flagship (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro), efficient (GPT-5 Mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash), and ultra-efficient tiers (GPT-5 Nano, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite) against classifiers trained on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings on 5,000 images across 18 attributes. Our findings reveal that: (1) zero-shot VLMs achieve 64.0% macro-F1, a threefold improvement over logistic regression on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings; (2) VLMs excel at fine-grained classification (Tier 3: 70.8% F1) but struggle with applicability detection (Tier 2: 34.1% NA-F1), identifying a key bottleneck; (3) efficient models achieve over 90% of flagship performance at lower cost, offering practical deployment paths. This diagnostic framework enables practitioners to pinpoint whether errors stem from visibility detection or classification, guiding targeted improvements for production systems.",

On the AMD U280 FPGA at 16nm, the accelerator achieves 1.29$\\times$ end-to-end speedup, 1.64$\\times$ higher decode throughput, and 3.14$\\times$ better energy efficiency than an NVIDIA A100 GPU (7nm) running BF16 inference; projected results on the V80 FPGA at 7nm reach 4.71$\\times$, 6.55$\\times$, and 4.13$\\times$, respectively. In long-context scenarios, integrating the HMT plug-in reduces prefill latency by 23.23$\\times$ and extends the context window by 64$\\times$, delivering 1.10$\\times$/4.86$\\times$ lower end-to-end latency and 5.21$\\times$/6.27$\\times$ higher energy efficiency on the U280/V80 compared to the A100 baseline.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in LLM-based Text-to-SQL have achieved remarkable gains on public benchmarks such as BIRD and Spider. Yet, these systems struggle to scale in realistic enterprise settings with large, complex schemas, diverse SQL dialects, and expensive multi-step reasoning. Emerging agentic approaches show potential for adaptive reasoning but often suffer from inefficiency and instability-repeating interactions with databases, producing inconsistent outputs, and occasionally failing to generate valid answers. To address these challenges, we introduce Agent Semantic Memory (AgentSM), an agentic framework for Text-to-SQL that builds and leverages interpretable semantic memory. Instead of relying on raw scratchpads or vector retrieval, AgentSM captures prior execution traces-or synthesizes curated ones-as structured programs that directly guide future reasoning. This design enables systematic reuse of reasoning paths, which allows agents to scale to larger schemas, more complex questions, and longer trajectories efficiently and reliably. Compared to state-of-the-art systems, AgentSM achieves higher efficiency by reducing average token usage and trajectory length by 25% and 35%, respectively, on the Spider 2.0 benchmark. It also improves execution accuracy, reaching a state-of-the-art accuracy of 44.8% on the Spider 2.0 Lite benchmark.",

    "abstract": "Role-play prompting is known to steer the behavior of language models by injecting a persona into the prompt, improving their zero-shot reasoning capabilities. However, such improvements are inconsistent across different tasks or instances. This inconsistency suggests that zero-shot and role-play prompting may offer complementary strengths rather than one being universally superior. Building on this insight, we propose Persona Switch, a novel decoding method that dynamically combines the benefits of both prompting strategies. Our method proceeds step-by-step, selecting the better output between zero-shot and role-play prompting at each step by comparing their output confidence, as measured by the logit gap. Experiments with widely-used LLMs demonstrate that Persona Switch consistently outperforms competitive baselines, achieving up to 5.13% accuracy improvement. Furthermore, we show that output confidence serves as an informative measure for selecting the more reliable output.",

    "abstract": "Accurate alignment of multi-degree-of-freedom rehabilitation robots is essential for safe and effective patient training. This paper proposes a two-stage calibration framework for a self-designed three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) ankle rehabilitation robot. First, a Kronecker-product-based open-loop calibration method is developed to cast the input-output alignment into a linear parameter identification problem, which in turn defines the associated experimental design objective through the resulting information matrix. Building on this formulation, calibration posture selection is posed as a combinatorial design-of-experiments problem guided by a D-optimality criterion, i.e., selecting a small subset of postures that maximises the determinant of the information matrix. To enable practical selection under constraints, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent is trained in simulation to choose 4 informative postures from a candidate set of 50. Across simulation and real-robot evaluations, the learned policy consistently yields substantially more informative posture combinations than random selection: the mean determinant of the information matrix achieved by PPO is reported to be more than two orders of magnitude higher with reduced variance. In addition, real-world results indicate that a parameter vector identified from only four D-optimality-guided postures provides stronger cross-episode prediction consistency than estimates obtained from a larger but unstructured set of 50 postures. The proposed framework therefore improves calibration efficiency while maintaining robust parameter estimation, offering practical guidance for high-precision alignment of multi-DOF rehabilitation robots.",

    "abstract": "As frontier AI models are deployed globally, it is essential that their behaviour remains safe and reliable across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. To examine how current model safeguards hold up in such settings, participants from the International Network for Advanced AI Measurement, Evaluation and Science, including representatives from Singapore, Japan, Australia, Canada, the EU, France, Kenya, South Korea and the UK conducted a joint multilingual evaluation exercise. Led by Singapore AISI, two open-weight models were tested across ten languages spanning high and low resourced groups: Cantonese English, Farsi, French, Japanese, Korean, Kiswahili, Malay, Mandarin Chinese and Telugu. Over 6,000 newly translated prompts were evaluated across five harm categories (privacy, non-violent crime, violent crime, intellectual property and jailbreak robustness), using both LLM-as-a-judge and human annotation.   The exercise shows how safety behaviours can vary across languages. These include differences in safeguard robustness across languages and harm types and variation in evaluator reliability (LLM-as-judge vs. human review). Further, it also generated methodological insights for improving multilingual safety evaluations, such as the need for culturally contextualised translations, stress-tested evaluator prompts and clearer human annotation guidelines. This work represents an initial step toward a shared framework for multilingual safety testing of advanced AI systems and calls for continued collaboration with the wider research community and industry.",

Existing methods face a dilemma: uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods typically act as passive sensors, only diagnosing risks without addressing them, while self-reflection mechanisms suffer from continuous or aimless corrections. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified Dual-Process Agentic UQ (AUQ) framework that transforms verbalized uncertainty into active, bi-directional control signals. Our architecture comprises two complementary mechanisms: System 1 (Uncertainty-Aware Memory, UAM), which implicitly propagates verbalized confidence and semantic explanations to prevent blind decision-making; and System 2 (Uncertainty-Aware Reflection, UAR), which utilizes these explanations as rational cues to trigger targeted inference-time resolution only when necessary. This enables the agent to balance efficient execution and deep deliberation dynamically. Extensive experiments on closed-loop benchmarks and open-ended deep research tasks demonstrate that our training-free approach achieves superior performance and trajectory-level calibration. We believe this principled framework AUQ represents a significant step towards reliable agents.",

We demonstrate how uncertainty is leveraged as an active control signal across three frontiers: in \\textbf{advanced reasoning} to optimize computation and trigger self-correction; in \\textbf{autonomous agents} to govern metacognitive decisions about tool use and information seeking; and in \\textbf{reinforcement learning} to mitigate reward hacking and enable self-improvement via intrinsic rewards. By grounding these advancements in emerging theoretical frameworks like Bayesian methods and Conformal Prediction, we provide a unified perspective on this transformative trend. This survey provides a comprehensive overview, critical analysis, and practical design patterns, arguing that mastering the new trend of uncertainty is essential for building the next generation of scalable, reliable, and trustworthy AI.",

    "title": "Performance-guided Reinforced Active Learning for Object Detection",
    "abstract": "Active learning (AL) strategies aim to train high-performance models with minimal labeling efforts, only selecting the most informative instances for annotation. Current approaches to evaluating data informativeness predominantly focus on the data's distribution or intrinsic information content and do not directly correlate with downstream task performance, such as mean average precision (mAP) in object detection. Thus, we propose Performance-guided (i.e. mAP-guided) Reinforced Active Learning for Object Detection (MGRAL), a novel approach that leverages the concept of expected model output changes as informativeness. To address the combinatorial explosion challenge of batch sample selection and the non-differentiable correlation between model performance and selected batches, MGRAL skillfully employs a reinforcement learning-based sampling agent that optimizes selection using policy gradient with mAP improvement as reward. Moreover, to reduce the computational overhead of mAP estimation with unlabeled samples, MGRAL utilizes an unsupervised way with fast look-up tables, ensuring feasible deployment. We evaluate MGRAL's active learning performance on detection tasks over PASCAL VOC and COCO benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates the highest AL curve with convincing visualizations, establishing a new paradigm in reinforcement learning-driven active object detection.",

    "abstract": "Trigger-Action Programming (TAP) platforms such as IFTTT and Zapier enable Web of Things (WoT) automation by composing event-driven rules across heterogeneous services. A TAP applet links a trigger to an action and must bind trigger outputs (ingredients) to action inputs (fields) to be executable. Prior work largely treats TAP as service-level prediction from natural language, which often yields non-executable applets that still require manual configuration. We study the function-level configuration problem: generating complete applets with correct ingredient-to-field bindings. We propose FARM (Field-Aware Resolution Model), a two-stage architecture for automated applet generation with full configuration. Stage 1 trains contrastive dual encoders with selective layer freezing over schema-enriched representations, retrieving candidates from 1,724 trigger functions and 1,287 action functions (2.2M possible trigger-action pairs). Stage 2 performs selection and configuration using an LLM-based multi-agent pipeline. It includes intent analysis, trigger selection, action selection via cross-schema scoring, and configuration verification. Agents coordinate through shared state and agreement-based selection. FARM achieves 81% joint accuracy on Gold (62% Noisy, 70% One-shot) at the function level, where both trigger and action functions must match the ground truth. For comparison with service-level baselines, we map functions to their parent services and evaluate at the service level. FARM reaches 81% joint accuracy and improves over TARGE by 23 percentage points. FARM also generates ingredient-to-field bindings, producing executable automation configurations.",

    "abstract": "Model editing updates a pre-trained LLM with new facts or rules without re-training, while preserving unrelated behavior. In real deployment, edits arrive as long streams, and existing editors often face a plasticity-stability dilemma: locate-then-edit \"hard writes\" can accumulate interference over time, while null-space-style \"hard preservation\" preserves only what is explicitly constrained, so past edits can be overwritten and unconstrained behaviors may deviate, degrading general capabilities in the many-edits regime. We propose RLSEdit, a recursive least-squares editor for long sequential editing. RLSEdit formulates editing as an online quadratic optimization with soft constraints, minimizing a cumulative key-value fitting objective with two regularizers that control for both deviation from the pre-trained weights and from a designated anchor mapping. The resulting update admits an efficient online recursion via the Woodbury identity, with per-edit cost independent of history length and scaling only with the current edit size. We further provide deviation bounds and an asymptotic characterization of the adherence-preservation trade-off in the many-edits regime. Experiments on multiple model families demonstrate stable scaling to 10K edits, outperforming strong baselines in both edit success and holistic stability -- crucially retaining early edits, and preserving general capabilities on GLUE and held-out reasoning/code benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "We study mean estimation for Gaussian distributions under \\textit{personalized differential privacy} (PDP), where each record has its own privacy budget. PDP is commonly considered in two variants: \\textit{bounded} and \\textit{unbounded} PDP. In bounded PDP, the privacy budgets are public and neighboring datasets differ by replacing one record. In unbounded PDP, neighboring datasets differ by adding or removing a record; consequently, an algorithm must additionally protect participation information, making both the dataset size and the privacy profile sensitive. Existing works have only studied mean estimation over bounded distributions under bounded PDP. Different from mean estimation for distributions with bounded range, where each element can be treated equally and we only need to consider the privacy diversity of elements, the challenge for Gaussian is that, elements can have very different contributions due to the unbounded support. we need to jointly consider the privacy information and the data values. Such a problem becomes even more challenging under unbounded PDP, where the privacy information is protected and the way to compute the weights becomes unclear. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing optimal Gaussian mean estimators under both bounded and unbounded PDP, where in each setting we first derive lower bounds for both problems, following PDP mean estimators with the algorithmic upper bounds matching the corresponding lower bounds up to logarithmic factors.",

    "abstract": "Few-shot recognition in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery remains a critical bottleneck for real-world applications due to extreme data scarcity. A promising strategy involves synthesizing a large dataset with a generative adversarial network (GAN), pre-training a model via self-supervised learning (SSL), and then fine-tuning on the few labeled samples. However, this approach faces a fundamental paradox: conventional GANs themselves require abundant data for stable training, contradicting the premise of few-shot learning. To resolve this, we propose the consistency-regularized generative adversarial network (Cr-GAN), a novel framework designed to synthesize diverse, high-fidelity samples even when trained under these severe data limitations. Cr-GAN introduces a dual-branch discriminator that decouples adversarial training from representation learning. This architecture enables a channel-wise feature interpolation strategy to create novel latent features, complemented by a dual-domain cycle consistency mechanism that ensures semantic integrity. Our Cr-GAN framework is adaptable to various GAN architectures, and its synthesized data effectively boosts multiple SSL algorithms. Extensive experiments on the MSTAR and SRSDD datasets validate our approach, with Cr-GAN achieving a highly competitive accuracy of 71.21% and 51.64%, respectively, in the 8-shot setting, significantly outperforming leading baselines, while requiring only ~5 of the parameters of state-of-the-art diffusion models.

    "abstract": "The rapid rise of autonomous AI systems and advancements in agent capabilities are introducing new risks due to reduced oversight of real-world interactions. Yet agent testing remains nascent and is still a developing science. As AI agents begin to be deployed globally, it is important that they handle different languages and cultures accurately and securely.   To address this, participants from The International Network for Advanced AI Measurement, Evaluation and Science, including representatives from Singapore, Japan, Australia, Canada, the European Commission, France, Kenya, South Korea, and the United Kingdom have come together to align approaches to agentic evaluations.   This is the third exercise, building on insights from two earlier joint testing exercises conducted by the Network in November 2024 and February 2025. The objective is to further refine best practices for testing advanced AI systems.   The exercise was split into two strands: (1) common risks, including leakage of sensitive information and fraud, led by Singapore AISI; and (2) cybersecurity, led by UK AISI. A mix of open and closed-weight models were evaluated against tasks from various public agentic benchmarks. Given the nascency of agentic testing, our primary focus was on understanding methodological issues in conducting such tests, rather than examining test results or model capabilities. This collaboration marks an important step forward as participants work together to advance the science of agentic evaluations.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems integrate document retrieval with large language models and have been widely adopted. However, in privacy-related scenarios, RAG introduces a new privacy risk: adversaries can issue carefully crafted queries to exfiltrate sensitive content from the underlying corpus gradually. Although recent studies have demonstrated multi-turn extraction attacks, they rely on heuristics and fail to perform long-term extraction planning. To address these limitations, we formulate the RAG extraction attack as an adaptive stochastic coverage problem (ASCP). In ASCP, each query is treated as a probabilistic action that aims to maximize conditional marginal gain (CMG), enabling principled long-term planning under uncertainty. However, integrating ASCP with practical RAG attack faces three key challenges: unobservable CMG, intractability in the action space, and feasibility constraints. To overcome these challenges, we maintain a global attacker-side state to guide the attack. Building on this idea, we introduce RAGCRAWLER, which builds a knowledge graph to represent revealed information, uses this global state to estimate CMG, and plans queries in semantic space that target unretrieved regions. In comprehensive experiments across diverse RAG architectures and datasets, our proposed method, RAGCRAWLER, consistently outperforms all baselines. It achieves up to 84.4% corpus coverage within a fixed query budget and deliver an average improvement of 20.7% over the top-performing baseline. It also maintains high semantic fidelity and strong content reconstruction accuracy with low attack cost. Crucially, RAGCRAWLER proves its robustness by maintaining effectiveness against advanced RAG systems employing query rewriting and multi-query retrieval strategies. Our work reveals significant security gaps and highlights the pressing need for stronger safeguards for RAG.",

We propose CoFi-Agent (Tool-Augmented Coarse-to-Fine Agent), a hybrid architecture targeting edge servers and gateways. It performs fast local perception and triggers conditional forensic refinement only when uncertainty is detected. CoFi-Agent runs an initial single-pass on a local 7B Audio-LLM, then a cloud controller gates difficult cases and issues lightweight plans for on-device tools such as temporal re-listening and local ASR. On the MMAR benchmark, CoFi-Agent improves accuracy from 27.20% to 53.60%, while achieving a better accuracy-efficiency trade-off than an always-on investigation pipeline. Overall, CoFi-Agent bridges the perception gap via tool-enabled, conditional edge-cloud collaboration under practical system constraints.",

A considerable portion of the collected questions contains incorrect assumptions and dangerous intentions.

    "abstract": "Contemporary sequential recommendation methods are becoming more complex, shifting from classification to a diffusion-guided generative paradigm. However, the quality of guidance in the form of user information is often compromised by missing data in the observed sequences, leading to suboptimal generation quality. Existing methods address this by removing locally similar items, but overlook ``critical turning points'' in user interest, which are crucial for accurately predicting subsequent user intent. To address this, we propose a novel Counterfactual Attention Regulation Diffusion model (CARD), which focuses on amplifying the signal from key interest-turning-point items while concurrently identifying and suppressing noise within the user sequence. CARD consists of (1) a Dual-side Thompson Sampling method to identify sequences undergoing significant interest shift, and (2) a counterfactual attention mechanism for these sequences to quantify the importance of each item. In this manner, CARD provides the diffusion model with a high-quality guidance signal composed of dynamically re-weighted interaction vectors to enable effective generation. Experiments show our method works well on real-world data without being computationally expensive. Our code is available at https://github.com/yanqilong3321/CARD.",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based models, despite their promise for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), suffer from an inherent low-pass filtering effect that limits their effectiveness. This issue arises due to undifferentiated propagation of frequency components across layers, causing a progressive attenuation of high-frequency information crucial for capturing fine-grained temporal variations. To address this limitation, we propose Dualformer, a principled dual-domain framework that rethinks frequency modeling from a layer-wise perspective. Dualformer introduces three key components: (1) a dual-branch architecture that concurrently models complementary temporal patterns in both time and frequency domains; (2) a hierarchical frequency sampling module that allocates distinct frequency bands to different layers, preserving high-frequency details in lower layers while modeling low-frequency trends in deeper layers; and (3) a periodicity-aware weighting mechanism that dynamically balances contributions from the dual branches based on the harmonic energy ratio of inputs, supported theoretically by a derived lower bound. This design enables structured frequency modeling and adaptive integration of time-frequency features, effectively preserving high-frequency information and enhancing generalization. Extensive experiments conducted on eight widely used benchmarks demonstrate Dualformer's robustness and superior performance, particularly on heterogeneous or weakly periodic data.

    "title": "EmotionThinker: Prosody-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Explainable Speech Emotion Reasoning",
    "abstract": "Emotional information in speech plays a unique role in multimodal perception. However, current Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs), similar to conventional speech emotion recognition (SER) systems, still treat emotion understanding as a simple classification problem. This provides limited interpretability of predictions, while leaving the LLMs' expressive and reasoning capabilities underutilized. In this work, we take the first step to reformulate SER as a deep reasoning problem through reinforcement learning (RL). We propose EmotionThinker, which is designed to generate accurate emotion predictions with interpretable explanations grounded in fine-grained acoustic cues. To achieve this, we first construct EmotionCoT-35K, an emotional reasoning dataset with Chain-of-Thought annotations and detailed captions. Second, we observe that current SpeechLLMs exhibit weak prosody perception, whereas prosodic cues constitute fundamental signals for interpreting emotions. To address this, we develop the prosody-enhanced foundation model EmotionThinker-Base, and demonstrate that prosody enhancement improves emotion understanding. Third, we introduce Group-Relative-Policy-Optimization with Progressive-Trust-aware-Reasoning-Reward (GRPO-PTR) for RL. Different from standard GRPO, which relies only on rule-based outcome rewards, GRPO-PTR progressively introduces reasoning reward, dynamically adjusts it with a trustworthiness weight reflecting the alignment between reasoning and outcome, and evaluates the overall reasoning quality with a reward model based on multi-dimensional criteria. EmotionThinker outperforms previous state-of-the-art evaluation models both in emotion accuracy and explanation quality, advancing SER toward interpretable multimodal reasoning.

    "title": "Impression Zombies: Characteristics Analysis and Classification of New Harmful Accounts on Social Media",
    "abstract": "``Impression Zombies'', a type of malicious account designed to artificially inflate engagement metrics, have recently emerged as a significant threat on X (formerly Twitter). These accounts disseminate a high volume of low-quality, irrelevant posts, which degrade the user experience. This study aims (1) to quantitatively characterize their behavioral patterns and (2) to develop a method for detecting such accounts. To address the first objective, we collected data from 9,909 accounts and compared the characteristics of Impression Zombies and general users within this dataset. We find that, Impression Zombies post more than three times the average total number of posts per day and tend to gather followers by using phrases such as ``follow back.'' Addressing the second objective, we constructed a classification model for Impression Zombies that leverages the contextual incoherence often observed between parent posts and the replies from Impression Zombies. Experimental results show that our model achieved approximately 92\\% accuracy in detecting Impression Zombies. This study provides the first quantitative insights into Impression Zombies and offers a practical framework for detecting such accounts, contributing to platform transparency and the health of social media ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The recent surge in popularity of Nano-Banana and Seedream 4.0 underscores the community's strong interest in multi-image composition tasks. Compared to single-image editing, multi-image composition presents significantly greater challenges in terms of consistency and quality, yet existing models have not disclosed specific methodological details for achieving high-quality fusion. Through statistical analysis, we identify Human-Object Interaction (HOI) as the most sought-after category by the community. We therefore systematically analyze and implement a state-of-the-art solution for multi-image composition with a primary focus on HOI-centric tasks. We present Skywork UniPic 3.0, a unified multimodal framework that integrates single-image editing and multi-image composition. Our model supports an arbitrary (1~6) number and resolution of input images, as well as arbitrary output resolutions (within a total pixel budget of 1024x1024). To address the challenges of multi-image composition, we design a comprehensive data collection, filtering, and synthesis pipeline, achieving strong performance with only 700K high-quality training samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel training paradigm that formulates multi-image composition as a sequence-modeling problem, transforming conditional generation into unified sequence synthesis. To accelerate inference, we integrate trajectory mapping and distribution matching into the post-training stage, enabling the model to produce high-fidelity samples in just 8 steps and achieve a 12.5x speedup over standard synthesis sampling. Skywork UniPic 3.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image editing benchmark and surpasses both Nano-Banana and Seedream 4.0 on multi-image composition benchmark, thereby validating the effectiveness of our data pipeline and training paradigm.

    "abstract": "Realistic network traffic simulation is critical for evaluating intrusion detection systems, stress-testing network protocols, and constructing high-fidelity environments for cybersecurity training. While attack traffic can often be layered into training environments using red-teaming or replay methods, generating authentic benign background traffic remains a core challenge -- particularly in simulating the complex temporal and communication dynamics of real-world networks. This paper introduces TempoNet, a novel generative model that combines multi-task learning with multi-mark temporal point processes to jointly model inter-arrival times and all packet- and flow-header fields. TempoNet captures fine-grained timing patterns and higher-order correlations such as host-pair behavior and seasonal trends, addressing key limitations of GAN-, LLM-, and Bayesian-based methods that fail to reproduce structured temporal variation. TempoNet produces temporally consistent, high-fidelity traces, validated on real-world datasets. Furthermore, we show that intrusion detection models trained on TempoNet-generated background traffic perform comparably to those trained on real data, validating its utility for real-world security applications.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) transfers knowledge from large teacher models to compact student models, enabling efficient deployment on resource constrained devices. While diverse KD methods, including response based, feature based, and relation based approaches, capture different aspects of teacher knowledge, integrating multiple methods or knowledge sources is promising but often hampered by complex implementation, inflexible combinations, and catastrophic forgetting, which limits practical effectiveness.   This work proposes SMSKD (Sequential Multi Stage Knowledge Distillation), a flexible framework that sequentially integrates heterogeneous KD methods. At each stage, the student is trained with a specific distillation method, while a frozen reference model from the previous stage anchors learned knowledge to mitigate forgetting. In addition, we introduce an adaptive weighting mechanism based on the teacher true class probability (TCP) that dynamically adjusts the reference loss per sample to balance knowledge retention and integration.   By design, SMSKD supports arbitrary method combinations and stage counts with negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments show that SMSKD consistently improves student accuracy across diverse teacher student architectures and method combinations, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies confirm that stage wise distillation and reference model supervision are primary contributors to performance gains, with TCP based adaptive weighting providing complementary benefits. Overall, SMSKD is a practical and resource efficient solution for integrating heterogeneous KD methods.",

We propose a somaesthetic-inspired alternative that uses the human body, rather than written words, as the medium of expression. We coin this embodied journaling, as people's isolated body movements and spoken words become the canvas of reflection. We implemented embodied journaling in virtual reality and conducted a within-subject user study (n=20) to explore the emergent behaviours from the process and to compare its expressive and reflective qualities to those of written journaling. When writing-based norms and affordances were absent, we found that participants defaulted towards unfiltered emotional expression, often forgoing words altogether. Rather, subconscious body motion and paralinguistic acoustic qualities unveiled deeper, sometimes hidden feelings, prompting reflection that happens after emotional expression rather than during it. We discuss both the capabilities and pitfalls of embodied journaling, ultimately challenging the idea that reflection culminates in linguistic reasoning.",

Existing streaming systems rely on fixed-interval decoding or cache pruning, which either produce repetitive outputs or discard crucial temporal information. We introduce Event-VStream, an event-aware framework that represents continuous video as a sequence of discrete, semantically coherent events. Our system detects meaningful state transitions by integrating motion, semantic, and predictive cues, and triggers language generation only at those boundaries. Each event embedding is consolidated into a persistent memory bank, enabling long-horizon reasoning while maintaining low latency. Across OVOBench-Realtime, and long-form Ego4D evaluations, Event-VStream achieves competitive performance. It improves over a VideoLLM-Online-8B baseline by +10.4 points on OVOBench-Realtime, achieves performance close to Flash-VStream-7B despite using only a general-purpose LLaMA-3-8B text backbone, and maintains around 70% GPT-5 win rate on 2-hour Ego4D streams.",

    "abstract": "Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) -- generations that are plausible but factually unfaithful -- remain a critical barrier to high-stakes deployment. Current detection methods typically rely on computationally expensive external retrieval loops or opaque black-box LLM judges requiring 70B+ parameters. In this work, we introduce [Model Name], a hybrid detection framework that combines neuroscience-inspired signal design with supervised machine learning. We extract interpretable signals grounded in Predictive Coding (quantifying surprise against internal priors) and the Information Bottleneck (measuring signal retention under perturbation). Through systematic ablation, we demonstrate three key enhancements: Entity-Focused Uptake (concentrating on high-value tokens), Context Adherence (measuring grounding strength), and Falsifiability Score (detecting confident but contradictory claims).   Evaluating on HaluBench (n=200, perfectly balanced), our theory-guided baseline achieves 0.8017 AUROC. BASE supervised models reach 0.8274 AUROC, while IMPROVED features boost performance to 0.8669 AUROC (4.95% gain), demonstrating consistent improvements across architectures. This competitive performance is achieved while using 75x less training data than Lynx (200 vs 15,000 samples), 1000x faster inference (5ms vs 5s), and remaining fully interpretable. Crucially, we report a negative result: the Rationalization signal fails to distinguish hallucinations, suggesting that LLMs generate coherent reasoning for false premises (\"Sycophancy\").   This work demonstrates that domain knowledge encoded in signal architecture provides superior data efficiency compared to scaling LLM judges, achieving strong performance with lightweight (less than 1M parameter), explainable models suitable for production deployment.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale language models (LLMs) often offer clinical judgments based on incomplete information, increasing the risk of misdiagnosis. Existing studies have primarily evaluated confidence in single-turn, static settings, overlooking the coupling between confidence and correctness as clinical evidence accumulates during real consultations, which limits their support for reliable decision-making. We propose the first benchmark for assessing confidence in multi-turn interaction during realistic medical consultations. Our benchmark unifies three types of medical data for open-ended diagnostic generation and introduces an information sufficiency gradient to characterize the confidence-correctness dynamics as evidence increases. We implement and compare 27 representative methods on this benchmark; two key insights emerge: (1) medical data amplifies the inherent limitations of token-level and consistency-level confidence methods, and (2) medical reasoning must be evaluated for both diagnostic accuracy and information completeness. Based on these insights, we present MedConf, an evidence-grounded linguistic self-assessment framework that constructs symptom profiles via retrieval-augmented generation, aligns patient information with supporting, missing, and contradictory relations, and aggregates them into an interpretable confidence estimate through weighted integration. Across two LLMs and three medical datasets, MedConf consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both AUROC and Pearson correlation coefficient metrics, maintaining stable performance under conditions of information insufficiency and multimorbidity. These results demonstrate that information adequacy is a key determinant of credible medical confidence modeling, providing a new pathway toward building more reliable and interpretable large medical models.",

    "abstract": "3D occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in the realm of autonomous driving, as it provides a comprehensive understanding of the driving environment. Most existing methods construct dense scene representations for occupancy prediction, overlooking the inherent sparsity of real-world driving scenes. Recently, 3D superquadric representation has emerged as a promising sparse alternative to dense scene representations due to the strong geometric expressiveness of superquadrics. However, existing superquadric frameworks still suffer from insufficient temporal modeling, a challenging trade-off between query sparsity and geometric expressiveness, and inefficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting. To address these issues, we propose SuperOcc, a novel framework for superquadric-based 3D occupancy prediction. SuperOcc incorporates three key designs: (1) a cohesive temporal modeling mechanism to simultaneously exploit view-centric and object-centric temporal cues; (2) a multi-superquadric decoding strategy to enhance geometric expressiveness without sacrificing query sparsity; and (3) an efficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting scheme to improve computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the SurroundOcc and Occ3D benchmarks demonstrate that SuperOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior efficiency.

    "abstract": "Continual learning (CL) is a great endeavour in developing intelligent perception AI systems. However, the pioneer research has predominantly focus on single-task CL, which restricts the potential in multi-task and multimodal scenarios. Beyond the well-known issue of catastrophic forgetting, the multi-task CL also brings semantic obfuscation across multimodal alignment, leading to severe model degradation during incremental training steps. In this paper, we extend CL to continual panoptic perception (CPP), integrating multimodal and multi-task CL to enhance comprehensive image perception through pixel-level, instance-level, and image-level joint interpretation. We formalize the CL task in multimodal scenarios and propose an end-to-end continual panoptic perception model. Concretely, CPP model features a collaborative cross-modal encoder (CCE) for multimodal embedding. We also propose a malleable knowledge inheritance module via contrastive feature distillation and instance distillation, addressing catastrophic forgetting from task-interactive boosting manner. Furthermore, we propose a cross-modal consistency constraint and develop CPP+, ensuring multimodal semantic alignment for model updating under multi-task incremental scenarios. Additionally, our proposed model incorporates an asymmetric pseudo-labeling manner, enabling model evolving without exemplar replay. Extensive experiments on multimodal datasets and diverse CL tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, particularly in fine-grained CL tasks.",

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) increasingly exposes a gap in today's channel modeling. Efficient statistical models focus on coarse communication-centric metrics, and therefore miss the weak but critical multipath signatures for sensing, whereas deterministic models are computationally inefficient to scale for system-level ISAC evaluation. This gap calls for a unifying abstraction that can couple what the environment means for sensing with how the channel behaves for communication, namely, environmental semantics. This article clarifies the meaning and essentiality of environmental semantics in ISAC channel modeling and establishes how semantics is connected to observable channel structures across multiple semantic levels. Based on this perspective, a semantics-oriented channel modeling principle was advocated, which preserves environmental semantics while abstracting unnecessary detail to balance accuracy and complexity. Then, a generative AI-empowered semantic twin channel model (STCM) was introduced to generate a family of physically plausible channel realizations representative of a semantic condition. Case studies further show semantic consistency under challenging multi-view settings, suggesting a practical path to controllable simulation, dataset generation, and reproducible ISAC benchmarking toward future design and standardization.",

We expand on previous work in the literature by contributing some specific pipeline components, and three new real-time transfer learning Bayesian optimisation benchmarks. In particular we propose to use a weighting strategy for ensemble surrogate model predictions based on regularised regression with weights constrained to be positive, and a related component for handling the case when transfer learning is not improving Bayesian optimisation performance.

    "abstract": "In the study of time-dependent (i.e., temporal) networks, researchers often examine the evolution of communities, which are sets of densely connected sets of nodes that are connected sparsely to other nodes. An increasingly prominent approach to studying community structure in temporal networks is statistical inference. In the present paper, we study the performance of a class of statistical-inference methods for community detection in temporal networks. We represent temporal networks as multilayer networks, with each layer encoding a time step, and we illustrate that statistical-inference models that generate community assignments via either a uniform distribution on community assignments or discrete-time Markov processes are biased against generating communities with large or small numbers of nodes. In particular, we demonstrate that statistical-inference methods that use such generative models tend to poorly identify community structure in networks with large or small communities. To rectify this issue, we introduce a novel statistical model that generates the community assignments of the nodes in given layer (i.e., at a given time) using all of the community assignments in the previous layer. We prove results that guarantee that our approach greatly mitigates the bias against large and small communities, so using our generative model is beneficial for studying community structure in networks with large or small communities.

    "abstract": "In this work we introduce three ideas that can further improve particle FRNN physics simulations running on RT Cores; i) a real-time update/rebuild ratio optimizer for the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) structure, ii) a new RT core use, with two variants, that eliminates the need of a neighbor list and iii) a technique that enables RT cores for FRNN with periodic boundary conditions (BC). Experimental evaluation using the Lennard-Jones FRNN interaction model as a case study shows that the proposed update/rebuild ratio optimizer is capable of adapting to the different dynamics that emerge during a simulation, leading to a RT core pipeline up to $\\sim 3.4\\times$ faster than with other known approaches to manage the BVH. In terms of simulation step performance, the proposed variants can significantly improve the speedup and EE of the base RT core idea; from $\\sim1.3\\times$ at small radius to $\\sim2.0\\times$ for log normal radius distributions. Furthermore, the proposed variants manage to simulate cases that would otherwise not fit in memory because of the use of neighbor lists, such as clusters of particles with log normal radius distribution. The proposed RT Core technique to support periodic BC is indeed effective as it does not introduce any significant penalty in performance. In terms of scaling, the proposed methods scale both their performance and EE across GPU generations. Throughout the experimental evaluation, we also identify the simulation cases were regular GPU computation should still be preferred, contributing to the understanding of the strengths and limitations of RT cores.",

    "abstract": "Virtualization is widely adopted in cloud systems to manage resource sharing among users. A virtualized environment usually deploys a virtual switch within the host system to enable virtual machines to communicate with each other and with the physical network. The Open vSwitch (OVS) is one of the most popular software-based virtual switches. It maintains a cache hierarchy to accelerate packet forwarding from the host to virtual machines. We characterize the caching system inside OVS from a security perspective and identify three attack primitives. Based on the attack primitives, we present three remote attacks via OVS, breaking the isolation in virtualized environments. First, we identify remote covert channels using different caches. Second, we present a novel header recovery attack that leaks a remote user's packet header fields, breaking the confidentiality guarantees from the system. Third, we demonstrate a remote packet rate monitoring attack that recovers the packet rate of a remote victim. To defend against these attacks, we also discuss and evaluate mitigation solutions.",

As these capabilities diffuse across departments and vendors, health systems face agent sprawl, causing duplicated agents, unclear accountability, inconsistent controls, and tool permissions that persist beyond the original use case. Existing AI governance frameworks emphasize lifecycle risk management but provide limited guidance for the day-to-day operations of agent fleets. We propose a Unified Agent Lifecycle Management (UALM) blueprint derived from a rapid, practice-oriented synthesis of governance standards, agent security literature, and healthcare compliance requirements. UALM maps recurring gaps onto five control-plane layers: (1) an identity and persona registry, (2) orchestration and cross-domain mediation, (3) PHI-bounded context and memory, (4) runtime policy enforcement with kill-switch triggers, and (5) lifecycle management and decommissioning linked to credential revocation and audit logging. A companion maturity model supports staged adoption. UALM offers healthcare CIOs, CISOs, and clinical leaders an implementable pattern for audit-ready oversight that preserves local innovation and enables safer scaling across clinical and administrative domains.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OR GOAL: This study investigates how GenAI can be integrated with a criterion-referenced grading framework to improve the efficiency and quality of grading for mathematical assessments in engineering. It specifically explores the challenges demonstrators face with manual, model solution-based grading and how a GenAI-supported system can be designed to reliably identify student errors, provide high-quality feedback, and support human graders. The research also examines human graders' perceptions of the effectiveness of this GenAI-assisted approach. ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES: The study found that GenAI achieved an overall grading accuracy of 92.5%, comparable to two experienced human graders. The two researchers, who also served as subject demonstrators, perceived the GenAI as a helpful second reviewer that improved accuracy by catching small errors and provided more complete feedback than they could manually. A central outcome was the significant enhancement of formative feedback. However, they noted the GenAI tool is not yet reliable enough for autonomous use, especially with unconventional solutions. CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS/SUMMARY: This study demonstrates that GenAI, when paired with a structured, criterion-referenced framework using binary questions, can grade engineering mathematical assessments with an accuracy comparable to human experts. Its primary contribution is a novel methodological approach that embeds the generation of high-quality, scalable formative feedback directly into the assessment workflow. Future work should investigate student perceptions of GenAI grading and feedback.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can call tools effectively, yet they remain brittle in multi-turn execution: following a tool call error, smaller models often degenerate into repetitive invalid re-invocations, failing to interpret error feedback and self-correct. This brittleness hinders reliable real-world deployment, where the execution errors are inherently inevitable during tool interaction procedures. We identify a key limitation of current approaches: standard reinforcement learning (RL) treats errors as sparse negative rewards, providing no guidance on how to recover, while pre-collected synthetic error-correction datasets suffer from distribution mismatch with the model's on-policy error modes. To bridge this gap, we propose Fission-GRPO, a framework that converts execution errors into corrective supervision within the RL training loop. Our core mechanism fissions each failed trajectory into a new training instance by augmenting it with diagnostic feedback from a finetuned Error Simulator, then resampling recovery rollouts on-policy. This enables the model to learn from the precise errors it makes during exploration, rather than from static, pre-collected error cases. On the BFCL v4 Multi-Turn, Fission-GRPO improves the error recovery rate of Qwen3-8B by 5.7% absolute, crucially, yielding a 4% overall accuracy gain (42.75% to 46.75%) over GRPO and outperforming specialized tool-use agents.",

    "abstract": "Most prior deepfake detection methods lack explainable outputs. With the growing interest in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), researchers have started exploring their use in interpretable deepfake detection. However, a major obstacle in applying MLLMs to this task is the scarcity of high-quality datasets with detailed forgery attribution annotations, as textual annotation is both costly and challenging - particularly for high-fidelity forged images or videos. Moreover, multiple studies have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially enhance performance in visual tasks, especially in improving cross-domain generalization. To facilitate the adoption of mainstream MLLM frameworks in deepfake detection with reduced annotation cost, and to investigate the potential of RL in this context, we propose an automated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data generation framework based on Self-Blended Images, along with an RL-enhanced deepfake detection framework. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our CoT data construction pipeline, tailored reward mechanism, and feedback-driven synthetic data generation approach.

We work on 1-identification with two main contributions. (1) We utilize an optimization formulation to derive a new lower bound of $\\mathbb{E}τ$, when there is at least one qualified arm.

    "abstract": "Cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition (EER) remains challenging due to strong inter-subject variability, which induces substantial distribution shifts in EEG signals, as well as the high complexity of emotion-related neural representations in both spatial organization and temporal evolution. Existing approaches typically improve spatial modeling, temporal modeling, or generalization strategies in isolation, which limits their ability to align representations across subjects while capturing multi-scale dynamics and suppressing subject-specific bias within a unified framework. To address these gaps, we propose a Region-aware Spatiotemporal Modeling framework with Collaborative Domain Generalization (RSM-CoDG) for cross-subject EEG emotion recognition. RSM-CoDG incorporates neuroscience priors derived from functional brain region partitioning to construct region-level spatial representations, thereby improving cross-subject comparability. It also employs multi-scale temporal modeling to characterize the dynamic evolution of emotion-evoked neural activity. In addition, the framework employs a collaborative domain generalization strategy, incorporating multidimensional constraints to reduce subject-specific bias in a fully unseen target subject setting, which enhances the generalization to unknown individuals. Extensive experimental results on SEED series datasets demonstrate that RSM-CoDG consistently outperforms existing competing methods, providing an effective approach for improving robustness.

Despite its empirical success, it remains unclear whether RLVR elicits novel capabilities or merely sharpens the distribution over existing knowledge. We study this by formalizing over-sharpening, a phenomenon where the policy collapses onto limited modes, suppressing valid alternatives. At a high level, we discover finite-batch updates intrinsically bias learning toward sampled modes, triggering a collapse that propagates globally via semantic coupling. To mitigate this, we propose inverse-success advantage calibration to prioritize difficult queries and distribution-level calibration to diversify sampling via a memory network.

Plume tracking on small quadrotors would allow these systems to operate around humans and fly in more confined spaces, but can be challenging due to poor sensitivity and long response times from gas sensors that fit on small quadrotors. In this work, we present an approach to complement chemical plume tracking with airflow source-seeking behavior using a custom flow sensor that can sense both airflow magnitude and direction on small quadrotors < 100 g. We use this sensor to implement a modified version of the `Cast and Surge' algorithm that takes advantage of flow direction sensing to find and navigate towards flow sources. A series of characterization experiments verified that the system can detect airflow while in flight and reorient the quadrotor toward the airflow. Several trials with random starting locations and orientations were used to show that our source-seeking algorithm can reliably find a flow source. This work aims to provide a foundation for future platforms that can use flow sensors in concert with other sensors to enable richer plume tracking data collection and source-seeking.",

Traditional moderation approaches, such as human annotation and keyword-based filtering, have demonstrated utility, but human moderators on Twitch constantly struggle to scale effectively in the fast-paced, high-volume, and context-rich chat environment of the platform while also facing harassment themselves. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Llama-3-8B-Instruct, offer new opportunities for toxicity detection, especially in understanding nuanced, multimodal communication involving emotes. In this work, we present an exploratory comparison of toxicity detection approaches tailored to Twitch. Our analysis reveals that incorporating emotes improves the detection of toxic behavior. To this end, we introduce ToxiTwitch, a hybrid model that combines LLM-generated embeddings of text and emotes with traditional machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest and SVM. In our case study, the proposed hybrid approach reaches up to 80 percent accuracy under channel-specific training (with 13 percent improvement over BERT and F1-score of 76 percent).

    "abstract": "Hierarchical Bayesian models are increasingly used in large, inhomogeneous complex network dynamical systems by modeling parameters as draws from a hyperparameter-governed distribution. However, theoretical guarantees for these estimates as the system size grows have been lacking. A critical concern is that hyperparameter estimation may diverge for larger networks, undermining the model's reliability. Formulating the system's evolution in a measure transport perspective, we propose a theoretical framework for estimating hyperparameters with mean-type observations, which are prevalent in many scientific applications. Our primary contribution is a nonasymptotic bound for the deviation of estimate of hyperparameters in inhomogeneous complex network dynamical systems with respect to network population size, which is established for a general family of optimization algorithms within a fixed observation duration. While we firstly establish a consistency result for systems with independent nodes, our main result extends this guarantee to the more challenging and realistic setting of weakly-dependent nodes. We validate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments on two representative models: a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model and a Spiking Neuronal Network model. In both cases, the results confirm that the estimation error decreases as the network population size increases, aligning with our theoretical guarantees. This research proposes the foundational theory to ensure that hierarchical Bayesian methods are statistically consistent for large-scale inhomogeneous systems, filling a gap in this area of theoretical research and justifying their application in practice.",

    "title": "Does 6G Need a New Waveform: Comparing Zak-OTFS with CP-OFDM",
    "abstract": "Across the world, there is growing interest in new waveforms, Zak-OTFS in particular, and over-the-air implementations are starting to appear. The choice between OFDM and Zak-OTFS is not so much a choice between waveforms as it is an architectural choice between preventing inter-carrier interference (ICI) and embracing ICI. In OFDM, once the Input-Output (I/O) relation is known, equalization is relatively simple, at least when there is no ICI. However, in the presence of ICI the I/O relation is non-predictable and its acquisition is non-trivial. In contrast, equalization is more involved in Zak-OTFS due to inter-symbol-interference (ISI), however the I/O relation is predictable and its acquisition is simple. {Zak-OTFS exhibits superior performance in doubly-spread 6G use cases with high delay/Doppler channel spreads (i.e., high mobility and/or large cells), but architectural choice is governed by the typical use case, today and in the future. What is typical depends to some degree on geography, since large delay spread is a characteristic of large cells which are the rule rather than the exception in many important wireless markets.} This paper provides a comprehensive performance comparison of cyclic prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM) and Zak-OTFS across the full range of 6G propagation environments. The performance results provide insights into the fundamental architectural choice.",

    "title": "Tackling the Scaffolding Paradox: A Person-Centered Adaptive Robotic Interview Coach",
    "abstract": "Job interview anxiety is a prevalent challenge among university students and can undermine both performance and confidence in high-stakes evaluative situations. Social robots have shown promise in reducing anxiety through emotional support, yet how such systems should balance psychological safety with effective instructional guidance remains an open question. In this work, we present a three-phase iterative design study of a robotic interview coach grounded in Person-Centered Therapy (PCT) and instructional scaffolding theory. Across three weekly sessions (N=8), we systematically explored how different interaction strategies shape users' emotional experience, cognitive load, and perceived utility. Phase I demonstrated that a PCT-based robot substantially increased perceived psychological safety but introduced a Safety-Guidance Gap, in which users felt supported yet insufficiently coached. Phase II revealed a Scaffolding Paradox: immediate feedback improved clarity but disrupted conversational flow and increased cognitive load, whereas delayed feedback preserved realism but lacked actionable specificity. To resolve this tension, Phase III introduced an Agency-Driven Interaction Mode that allowed users to opt in to feedback dynamically. Qualitative findings indicated that user control acted as an anxiety buffer, restoring trust, reducing overload, and reframing the interaction as collaborative rather than evaluative. Quantitative measures further showed significant reductions in interview-related social and communication anxiety, while maintaining high perceived warmth and therapeutic alliance. We synthesize these findings into an Adaptive Scaffolding Ecosystem framework, highlighting user agency as a key mechanism for balancing emotional support and instructional guidance in social robot coaching systems.",

    "abstract": "Current business environments require organizations to continuously reconfigure cross-functional processes, yet enterprise systems are still organized around siloed departments, rigid workflows, and hard-coded automation. Meanwhile large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting natural language and unstructured data but lack deterministic, verifiable execution of complex business logic. To address this gap, here we introduce AUTOBUS, an Autonomous Business System that integrates LLM-based AI agents, predicate-logic programming, and business-semantics-centric enterprise data into a coherent neuro-symbolic AI architecture for orchestrating end-to-end business initiatives. AUTOBUS models an initiative as a network of tasks with explicit pre/post conditions, required data, evaluation rules, and API-level actions. Enterprise data is organized as a knowledge graph whose entities, relationships, and constraints are translated into logic facts and foundational rules, providing the semantic grounding for task reasoning. Core AI agents synthesize task instructions, enterprise semantics, and available tools into task-specific logic programs, which are executed by a logic engine that enforces constraints, coordinates auxiliary tools, and orchestrate execution of actions and outcomes. Humans define and maintain the semantics, policies and task instructions, curate tools, and supervise high-impact or ambiguous decisions, ensuring accountability and adaptability. We detail the AUTOBUS architecture, the anatomy of the AI agent generated logic programs, and the role of humans and auxiliary tools in the lifecycle of a business initiative.",

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising energy-efficient models and powerful framworks of modeling neuron dynamics. However, existing binary spiking neurons exhibit limited biological plausibilities and low information capacity. Recently developed ternary spiking neuron possesses higher consistency with biological principles (i.e. excitation-inhibition balance mechanism). Despite of this, the ternary spiking neuron suffers from defects including iterative information loss, temporal gradient vanishing and irregular distributions of membrane potentials. To address these issues, we propose Complemented Ternary Spiking Neuron (CTSN), a novel ternary spiking neuron model that incorporates an learnable complemental term to store information from historical inputs. CTSN effectively improves the deficiencies of ternary spiking neuron, while the embedded learnable factors enable CTSN to adaptively adjust neuron dynamics, providing strong neural heterogeneity. Furthermore, based on the temporal evolution features of ternary spiking neurons' membrane potential distributions, we propose the Temporal Membrane Potential Regularization (TMPR) training method. TMPR introduces time-varying regularization strategy utilizing membrane potentials, furhter enhancing the training process by creating extra backpropagation paths. We validate our methods through extensive experiments on various datasets, demonstrating remarkable performance advances.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a neural network-based nonlinear shrinkage estimator of covariance matrices for the purpose of minimum variance portfolio optimization. It is a hybrid approach that integrates statistical estimation with machine learning. Starting from the Ledoit-Wolf (LW) shrinkage estimator, we decompose the LW covariance matrix into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and apply a lightweight transformer-based neural network to learn a nonlinear eigenvalue shrinkage function. Trained with portfolio risk as the loss function, the resulting precision matrix (the inverse covariance matrix) estimator directly targets portfolio risk minimization. By conditioning on the sample-to-dimension ratio, the approach remains scalable across different sample sizes and asset universes. Empirical results on stock daily returns from Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P500) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves lower out-of-sample realized risk than benchmark approaches. This highlights the promise of integrating structural statistical models with data-driven learning.",

    "abstract": "While modern Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems achieve high fidelity for read-style speech, they struggle to generate Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR), a specialized, low-intensity speech style essential for relaxation. The inherent challenges include ASMR's subtle, often unvoiced characteristics and the demand for zero-shot speaker adaptation. In this paper, we introduce DeepASMR, the first framework designed for zero-shot ASMR generation. We demonstrate that a single short snippet of a speaker's ordinary, read-style speech is sufficient to synthesize high-fidelity ASMR in their voice, eliminating the need for whispered training data from the target speaker. Methodologically, we first identify that discrete speech tokens provide a soft factorization of ASMR style from speaker timbre. Leveraging this insight, we propose a two-stage pipeline incorporating a Large Language Model (LLM) for content-style encoding and a flow-matching acoustic decoder for timbre reconstruction. Furthermore, we contribute DeepASMR-DB, a comprehensive 670-hour English-Chinese multi-speaker ASMR speech corpus, and introduce a novel evaluation protocol integrating objective metrics, human listening tests, LLM-based scoring and unvoiced speech analysis. Extensive experiments confirm that DeepASMR achieves state-of-the-art naturalness and style fidelity in ASMR generation for anyone of any voice, while maintaining competitive performance on normal speech synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit powerful capabilities but risk memorizing sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) from their training data, posing significant privacy concerns. While machine unlearning techniques aim to remove such data, they predominantly depend on access to the training data. This requirement is often impractical, as training data in real-world deployments is commonly proprietary or inaccessible. To address this limitation, we propose Data-Free Selective Unlearning (DFSU), a novel privacy-preserving framework that removes sensitive PII from an LLM without requiring its training data. Our approach first synthesizes pseudo-PII through language model inversion, then constructs token-level privacy masks for these synthetic samples, and finally performs token-level selective unlearning via a contrastive mask loss within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) subspace. Extensive experiments on the AI4Privacy PII-Masking dataset using Pythia models demonstrate that our method effectively removes target PII while maintaining model utility.",

    "abstract": "As 6G networks evolve, spectrum assets require flexible, dynamic, and efficient utilization, motivating blockchain based spectrum securitization. Existing approaches based on ERC404 style hybrid token models rely on frequent minting and burning during asset transfers, which disrupt token identity continuity and increase on chain overhead. This paper proposes the Semi Fungible Token Lock (SFT Lock) method, a lock/unlock based mechanism that preserves NFT identity and historical traceability while enabling fractional ownership and transferability. By replacing mint/burn operations with deterministic state transitions, SFT Lock ensures consistent lifecycle representation of spectrum assets and significantly reduces on chain operations. Based on this mechanism, a modular smart contract architecture is designed to support spectrum authorization, securitization, and sharing, and a staking mechanism is introduced to enhance asset liquidity. Experimental results on a private Ethereum network demonstrate that, compared with ERC404 style hybrid token models, the proposed method achieves substantial gas savings while maintaining functional correctness and traceability.",

    "abstract": "Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) promise parallel token generation and arbitrary-order decoding, yet it remains unclear to what extent current models truly realize these capabilities. We characterize MDLM behavior along two dimensions -- parallelism strength and generation order -- using Average Finalization Parallelism (AFP) and Kendall's tau. We evaluate eight mainstream MDLMs (up to 100B parameters) on 58 benchmarks spanning knowledge, reasoning, and programming. The results show that MDLMs still lag behind comparably sized autoregressive models, mainly because parallel probabilistic modeling weakens inter-token dependencies. Meanwhile, MDLMs exhibit adaptive decoding behavior: their parallelism and generation order vary significantly with the task domain, the stage of reasoning, and whether the output is correct. On tasks that require \"backward information\" (e.g., Sudoku), MDLMs adopt a solution order that tends to fill easier Sudoku blanks first, highlighting their advantages. Finally, we provide theoretical motivation and design insights supporting a Generate-then-Edit paradigm, which mitigates dependency loss while retaining the efficiency of parallel decoding.",

    "abstract": "Managing perishable products with limited lifetimes is a fundamental challenge in inventory management, as poor ordering decisions can quickly lead to stockouts or excessive waste. We study a perishable inventory system with random lead times in which both the demand process and the lead time distribution are unknown. We consider a practical setting where orders are placed using limited historical data together with observed covariates and current system states. To improve learning efficiency under limited data, we adopt a marginal cost accounting scheme that assigns each order a single lifetime cost and yields a unified loss function for end-to-end learning. This enables training a deep learning-based policy that maps observed covariates and system states directly to order quantities. We develop two end-to-end variants: a purely black-box approach that outputs order quantities directly (E2E-BB), and a structure-guided approach that embeds the projected inventory level (PIL) policy, capturing inventory effects through explicit computation rather than additional learning (E2E-PIL). We further show that the objective induced by E2E-PIL is homogeneous of degree one, enabling a boosting technique from operational data analytics (ODA) that yields an enhanced policy (E2E-BPIL). Experiments on synthetic and real data establish a robust performance ordering: E2E-BB is dominated by E2E-PIL, which is further improved by E2E-BPIL. Using an excess-risk decomposition, we show that embedding heuristic policy structure reduces effective model complexity and improves learning efficiency with only a modest loss of flexibility. More broadly, our results suggest that deep learning-based decision tools are more effective and robust when guided by human knowledge, highlighting the value of integrating advanced analytics with inventory theory.",

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, safety guardrails are required to go beyond coarse-grained filtering and support fine-grained, interpretable, and adaptable risk assessment. However, existing solutions often rely on rapid classification schemes or post-hoc rules, resulting in limited transparency, inflexible policies, or prohibitive inference costs. To this end, we present YuFeng-XGuard, a reasoning-centric guardrail model family designed to perform multi-dimensional risk perception for LLM interactions. Instead of producing opaque binary judgments, YuFeng-XGuard generates structured risk predictions, including explicit risk categories and configurable confidence scores, accompanied by natural language explanations that expose the underlying reasoning process. This formulation enables safety decisions that are both actionable and interpretable. To balance decision latency and explanatory depth, we adopt a tiered inference paradigm that performs an initial risk decision based on the first decoded token, while preserving ondemand explanatory reasoning when required. In addition, we introduce a dynamic policy mechanism that decouples risk perception from policy enforcement, allowing safety policies to be adjusted without model retraining. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of public safety benchmarks demonstrate that YuFeng-XGuard achieves stateof-the-art performance while maintaining strong efficiency-efficacy trade-offs. We release YuFeng-XGuard as an open model family, including both a full-capacity variant and a lightweight version, to support a wide range of deployment scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in mobile and wireless networks are unlocking the full potential of robotic autonomy, enabling robots to take advantage of ultra-low latency, high data throughput, and ubiquitous connectivity. However, for robots to navigate and operate seamlessly, efficiently and reliably, they must have an accurate understanding of both their surrounding environment and the quality of radio signals. Achieving this in highly dynamic and ever-changing environments remains a challenging and largely unsolved problem. In this paper, we introduce MapViT, a two-stage Vision Transformer (ViT)-based framework inspired by the success of pre-train and fine-tune paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs). MapViT is designed to predict both environmental changes and expected radio signal quality. We evaluate the framework using a set of representative Machine Learning (ML) models, analyzing their respective strengths and limitations across different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage pipeline enables real-time prediction, with the ViT-based implementation achieving a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. This makes MapViT a promising solution for energy- and resource-constrained platforms such as mobile robots. Moreover, the geometry foundation model derived from the self-supervised pre-training stage improves data efficiency and transferability, enabling effective downstream predictions even with limited labeled data. Overall, this work lays the foundation for next-generation digital twin ecosystems, and it paves the way for a new class of ML foundation models driving multi-modal intelligence in future 6G-enabled systems.",

The best-performing methods for each individual metric achieved 90.26\\% mDSC, 38.88 mHD, and 32.85 ms RT, respectively. FUGC establishes a standardized benchmark for cervical segmentation, demonstrates the efficacy of semi-supervised methods with limited labeled data, and provides a foundation for AI-assisted clinical PTB risk assessment.",

    "abstract": "Many multiagent systems rely on collective decision-making among self-interested agents, which raises deep questions about coalition formation and stability. We study social choice with endogenous, outcome-contingent transfers, where agents voluntarily form contracts that redistribute utility depending on the collective decision, allowing fully strategic, incentive-aligned coalition formation. We show that under consensus rules, individually rational strong Nash equilibria (IR-SNE) always exist, implementing welfare-maximizing outcomes with feasible transfers, and provide a simple, efficient algorithm to construct them. For more general anonymous, monotonic, and resolute rules, we identify necessary conditions for profitable deviations, sharply limiting destabilizing coalitions. By bridging cooperative and noncooperative perspectives, our approach shows that transferable utility can achieve core-like stability, restoring efficiency and budget balance even where classical impossibility results apply. Overall, this framework offers a practical and robust way to coordinate large-scale strategic multiagent systems.",

    "abstract": "This article critically investigates the limitations of the simulated annealing algorithm using probabilistic bits (pSA) in solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. The study begins with an in-depth analysis of the pSA process, focusing on the issues resulting from unexpected oscillations among p-bits. These oscillations hinder the energy reduction of the Ising model and thus obstruct the successful execution of pSA in complex tasks. Through detailed simulations, we unravel the root cause of this energy stagnation, identifying the feedback mechanism inherent to the pSA operation as the primary contributor to these disruptive oscillations. To address this challenge, we propose two novel algorithms, time average pSA (TApSA) and stalled pSA (SpSA). These algorithms are designed based on partial deactivation of p-bits and are thoroughly tested using Python simulations on maximum cut benchmarks that are typical combinatorial optimization problems. On the 16 benchmarks from 800 to 5,000 nodes, the proposed methods improve the normalized cut value from 0.8% to 98.4% on average in comparison with the conventional pSA.",

    "abstract": "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have achieved remarkable success in high-fidelity image generation. However, evaluating their semantic controllability-specifically for fine-grained, single-domain tasks-remains challenging. Standard metrics like FID and Inception Score (IS) often fail to detect identity misalignment in such specialized contexts. In this work, we investigate Class-Conditional DDPMs for K-pop idol face generation (32x32), a domain characterized by high inter-class similarity. We propose a calibrated metric, Relative Classification Accuracy (RCA), which normalizes generative performance against an oracle classifier's baseline. Our evaluation reveals a critical trade-off: while the model achieves high visual quality (FID 8.93), it suffers from severe semantic mode collapse (RCA 0.27), particularly for visually ambiguous identities. We analyze these failure modes through confusion matrices and attribute them to resolution constraints and intra-gender ambiguity. Our framework provides a rigorous standard for verifying identity consistency in conditional generative models.",

Experimental results show that LLM edited responses significantly increase perceived empathy while preserving factual accuracy compared with fully LLM generated outputs.

This paper presents a mixed-methods survey experiment investigating whether readers with ML expertise can distinguish between human- and LLM-generated abstracts, how actual and perceived LLM involvement affects judgments of quality and trustworthiness, and what orientations readers adopt toward AI-assisted writing. Our findings show that participants struggle to reliably identify LLM-generated content, yet their beliefs about LLM involvement significantly shape their evaluations. Notably, abstracts edited by LLMs are rated more favorably than those written solely by humans or LLMs. We also identify three distinct reader orientations toward LLM-assisted writing, offering insights into evolving norms and informing policy around disclosure and acceptable use in scientific communication.",

However, most existing systems remain fragmented, specializing in either knowledge tracing, diagnostic modeling, or resource recommendation, but rarely integrating these components into a cohesive adaptive cycle. In this paper, we propose ALIGNAgent (Adaptive Learner Intelligence for Gap Identification and Next-step guidance), a multi-agent educational framework designed to deliver personalized learning through integrated knowledge estimation, skill-gap identification, and targeted resource recommendation.ALIGNAgent begins by processing student quiz performance, gradebook data, and learner preferences to generate topic-level proficiency estimates using a Skill Gap Agent that employs concept-level diagnostic reasoning to identify specific misconceptions and knowledge deficiencies. After identifying skill gaps, the Recommender Agent retrieves preference-aware learning materials aligned with diagnosed deficiencies, implementing a continuous feedback loop where interventions occur before advancing to subsequent topics. Extensive empirical evaluation on authentic datasets from two undergraduate computer science courses demonstrates ALIGNAgent's effectiveness, with GPT-4o-based agents achieving precision of 0.87-0.90 and F1 scores of 0.84-0.87 in knowledge proficiency estimation validated against actual exam performance.",

But does cultural commonsense hold uniformly within a nation, or does it vary at the sub-national level? We introduce Indica, the first benchmark designed to test LLMs' ability to address this question, focusing on India - a nation of 28 states, 8 union territories, and 22 official languages. We collect human-annotated answers from five Indian regions (North, South, East, West, and Central) across 515 questions spanning 8 domains of everyday life, yielding 1,630 region-specific question-answer pairs. Strikingly, only 39.4% of questions elicit agreement across all five regions, demonstrating that cultural commonsense in India is predominantly regional, not national. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs and find two critical gaps: models achieve only 13.4%-20.9% accuracy on region-specific questions, and they exhibit geographic bias, over-selecting Central and North India as the \"default\" (selected 30-40% more often than expected) while under-representing East and West. Beyond India, our methodology provides a generalizable framework for evaluating cultural commonsense in any culturally heterogeneous nation, from question design grounded in anthropological taxonomy, to regional data collection, to bias measurement.",

    "abstract": "Generalizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to novel video domains is essential for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data. While In-Context Learning (ICL) offers a training-free adaptation path, standard methods rely on large annotated pools, which are often impractical in specialized environments like industrial or surgical settings since they require the experts' annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce VIOLA (Video In-cOntext Learning with minimal Annotation), a label-efficient framework that synergizes minimal expert supervision with abundant unlabeled data. First, to maximize the efficiency of a strict annotation budget, we propose density-uncertainty-weighted sampling. Unlike standard diversity or uncertainty strategies that risk selecting visual outliers, our method leverages density estimation to identify samples that are simultaneously diverse, representative, and informative. Second, to utilize the remaining unlabeled data without noise propagation, we construct a hybrid pool and introduce confidence-aware retrieval and confidence-aware prompting. These mechanisms explicitly model label reliability, retrieving demonstrations based on a composite score of similarity and confidence while enabling the MLLM to adaptively distinguish between verified ground truths and noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments across nine diverse benchmarks using four MLLMs demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms various baselines in low-resource settings, achieving robust adaptation with minimal annotation costs.",

    "abstract": "Real-world scientific applications frequently encounter incomplete observational data due to sensor limitations, geographic constraints, or measurement costs. Although neural operators significantly advanced PDE solving in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy, their underlying assumption of fully-observed spatial inputs severely restricts applicability in real-world applications. We introduce the first systematic framework for learning neural operators from partial observation. We identify and formalize two fundamental obstacles: (i) the supervision gap in unobserved regions that prevents effective learning of physical correlations, and (ii) the dynamic spatial mismatch between incomplete inputs and complete solution fields. Specifically, our proposed Latent Autoregressive Neural Operator~(\\ours) introduces two novel components designed explicitly to address the core difficulties of partial observations: (i) a mask-to-predict training strategy that creates artificial supervision by strategically masking observed regions, and (ii) a Physics-Aware Latent Propagator that reconstructs solutions through boundary-first autoregressive generation in latent space. Additionally, we develop POBench-PDE, a dedicated and comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for evaluating neural operators under partial observation conditions across three PDE-governed tasks. \\ours achieves state-of-the-art performance with 18--69$\\%$ relative L2 error reduction across all benchmarks under patch-wise missingness with less than 50$\\%$ missing rate, including real-world climate prediction.

    "abstract": "A key task in ML is to optimize models at various stages, e.g. by choosing hyperparameters or picking a stopping point. A traditional ML approach is to use validation loss, i.e. to apply the training loss function on a validation set to guide these optimizations. However, ML for healthcare has a distinct goal from traditional ML: Models must perform well relative to specific clinical requirements, vs. relative to the loss function used for training. These clinical requirements can be captured more precisely by tailored metrics. Since many optimization tasks do not require the driving metric to be differentiable, they allow a wider range of options, including the use of metrics tailored to be clinically-relevant. In this paper we describe two controlled experiments which show how the use of clinically-tailored metrics provide superior model optimization compared to validation loss, in the sense of better performance on the clinical task. The use of clinically-relevant metrics for optimization entails some extra effort, to define the metrics and to code them into the pipeline. But it can yield models that better meet the central goal of ML for healthcare: strong performance in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "Targeted drug delivery in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract using magnetic robots offers a promising alternative to systemic treatments. However, controlling these robots is a major challenge. Stationary magnetic systems have a limited workspace, while mobile systems (e.g., coils on a robotic arm) suffer from a \"model-calibration bottleneck\", requiring complex, pre-calibrated physical models that are time-consuming to create and computationally expensive. This paper presents a compact, low-cost mobile magnetic manipulation platform that overcomes this limitation using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Our system features a compact four-electromagnet array mounted on a UR5 collaborative robot. A Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based control strategy is trained through a sim-to-real pipeline, enabling effective policy deployment within 15 minutes and significantly reducing setup time. We validated the platform by controlling a 7-mm magnetic capsule along 2D trajectories. Our DRL-based controller achieved a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.18~mm for a square path and 1.50~mm for a circular path. We also demonstrated successful tracking over a clinically relevant, 30 cm * 20 cm workspace. This work demonstrates a rapidly deployable, model-free control framework capable of precise magnetic manipulation in a large workspace,validated using a 2D GI phantom.",

Although prior approaches such as Tent, EATA etc. provide meaningful improvements under short evolving shifts, they struggle when the test distribution changes rapidly or over extremely long horizons. This challenge is exemplified by the CCC benchmark, where models operate over streams of 7.5M samples with continually changing corruption types and severities. We propose RDumb++, a principled extension of RDumb that introduces two drift-detection mechanisms i.e entropy-based drift scoring and KL-divergence drift scoring, together with adaptive reset strategies. These mechanisms allow the model to detect when accumulated adaptation becomes harmful and to recover before prediction collapse occurs. Across CCC-medium with three speeds and three seeds (nine runs, each containing one million samples), RDumb++ consistently surpasses RDumb, yielding approx 3% absolute accuracy gains while maintaining stable adaptation throughout the entire stream. Ablation experiments on drift thresholds and reset strengths further show that drift-aware resetting is essential for preventing collapse and achieving reliable long-horizon CTTA.",

In the proposed CompliantVLA-adaptor, a VLM interprets task context from images and natural language to adapt the stiffness and damping parameters of a VIC controller. These parameters are further regulated using real-time force/torque feedback to ensure interaction forces remain within safe thresholds. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the VLA baselines on a suite of complex contact-rich tasks, both in simulation and on real hardware, with improved success rates and reduced force violations. The overall success rate across all tasks increases from 9.86\\% to 17.29\\%, presenting a promising path towards safe contact-rich manipulation using VLAs.

    "abstract": "Deep learning models, particularly Transformers, are often criticized as \"black boxes\" and lack interpretability. We propose Prism, a white-box attention-based architecture derived from the principles of Maximizing Coding Rate Reduction ($\\text{MCR}^2$). By modeling the attention mechanism as a gradient ascent process on a distinct signal-noise manifold, we introduce two physical constraints: an overcomplete dictionary to expand the representational phase space, and an irrational frequency separation ($π$-RoPE) to enforce incoherence between signal and noise subspaces. We demonstrate that these geometric inductive biases can be viewed as a physical constraint and they are sufficient to induce unsupervised functional disentanglement alone. Using TinyStories as a controlled testbed for verifying spectral dynamics, we observe that Prism spontaneously specializes its attention heads into spectrally distinct regimes: low-frequency heads capturing long-range causal dependencies (signal) and high-frequency heads handling local syntactic constraints (noise). Our results suggest that interpretability and performance are not a trade-off, but can be unified through principled geometric construction.",

    "abstract": "Early detection of malignant skin lesions is critical for improving patient outcomes in aggressive, metastatic skin cancers. This study evaluates a comprehensive system for preliminary skin lesion assessment that combines the clinically established ABCD rule of dermoscopy (analyzing Asymmetry, Borders, Color, and Dermoscopic Structures) with machine learning classification. Using a 1,000-image subset of the HAM10000 dataset, the system implements an automated, rule-based pipeline to compute a Total Dermoscopy Score (TDS) for each lesion. This handcrafted approach is compared against various machine learning solutions, including traditional classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM) and deep learning models. While the rule-based system provides high clinical interpretability, results indicate a performance bottleneck when reducing complex morphology to five numerical features. Experimental findings show that transfer learning with EfficientNet-B0 failed significantly due to domain shift between natural and medical images. In contrast, a custom three-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained from scratch achieved 78.5% accuracy and 86.5% recall on median-filtered images, representing a 19-point accuracy improvement over traditional methods. The results demonstrate that direct pixel-level learning captures diagnostic patterns beyond handcrafted features and that purpose-built lightweight architectures can outperform large pretrained models for small, domain-specific medical datasets.",

    "abstract": "Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge (e.g., copyrighted or private data) from a trained model without full retraining. In practice, models are often quantized (e.g., 4-bit) for deployment, but we find that quantization can catastrophically restore forgotten information [1]. In this paper, we (1) analyze why low-bit quantization undermines unlearning, and (2) propose a quantization-aware unlearning method to mitigate this. We first compute weight-change statistics and bucket overlaps in quantization to show that typical unlearning updates are too small to cross quantization thresholds. Building on this insight, we introduce a logits space hinge loss: for each forget example, we force the output logits of the unlearned model to differ from the original model by at least a margin (half the quantization step). This ensures forgotten examples remain distinguishable even after quantization. We evaluate on language and classification tasks (including a Twitter misinformation dataset) and show our method preserves forgetting under 4-bit quantization, whereas existing methods almost entirely recover the forgotten knowledge.",

    "abstract": "A world model is an AI system that simulates how an environment evolves under actions, enabling planning through imagined futures rather than reactive perception. Current world models, however, suffer from visual conflation: the mistaken assumption that high-fidelity video generation implies an understanding of physical and causal dynamics. We show that while modern models excel at predicting pixels, they frequently violate invariant constraints, fail under intervention, and break down in safety-critical decision-making. This survey argues that visual realism is an unreliable proxy for world understanding. Instead, effective world models must encode causal structure, respect domain-specific constraints, and remain stable over long horizons. We propose a reframing of world models as actionable simulators rather than visual engines, emphasizing structured 4D interfaces, constraint-aware dynamics, and closed-loop evaluation. Using medical decision-making as an epistemic stress test, where trial-and-error is impossible and errors are irreversible, we demonstrate that a world model's value is determined not by how realistic its rollouts appear, but by its ability to support counterfactual reasoning, intervention planning, and robust long-horizon foresight.",

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with multi- connectivity (MC) capabilities efficiently and reliably transfer data between terrestrial networks (TNs) and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs). However, optimally sharing and allocating spectrum and power resources to maintain MC while ensuring reliable connectivity and optimal performance remains challeng- ing in such networks. Channel variations induced by mobility in UAV networks, coupled with the varying quality of service (QoS) demands of heterogeneous devices, resource sharing, and fairness requirements in capacity distribution pose challenges to optimal resource allocation. Thus, this paper investigates resource allocation for QoS-constrained, MC-enabled, dynamic UAVs in an integrated TN-NTN environment with spectrum sharing and fairness considerations. To this end, we consider three types of links: UAV-to-radio base station (RBS), UAV-to-UAV, and UAV-to-HAP. We also assume two types of UAVs with diverse QoS requirements to reflect a practical scenario. Consequently, we propose two algorithms. The first algorithm maximizes the capacity of UAVs-RBS and UAVs-HAP links while ensuring the reliability of the UAV-UAV link. To achieve this, the algorithm maximizes the collective throughput of the UAVs by optimizing the sum capacity of all the UAV-RBS and UAV-HAP links. Next, to provide constant capacity to all links and ensure fairness, we propose another algorithm that maximizes the minimum capacity across all links. We validate the performance of both algorithms through simulation",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), defined as an abnormal buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain can be diagnosed with high accuracy based on protein biomarkers via PET or CSF analysis. However, due to the invasive nature of biomarker collection, most AD diagnoses are made in memory clinics using cognitive tests and evaluation of hippocampal atrophy based on MRI. While clinical assessment and hippocampal volume show high diagnostic accuracy for amnestic or typical AD (tAD), a substantial subgroup of AD patients with atypical presentation (atAD) are routinely misdiagnosed. To improve diagnosis of atAD patients, we propose a machine learning approach to distinguish between atAD and non-AD cognitive impairment using clinical testing battery and MRI data collected as standard-of-care. We develop and evaluate our approach using 1410 subjects across four groups (273 tAD, 184 atAD, 235 non-AD, and 685 cognitively normal) collected from one private data set and two public data sets from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We perform multiple atAD vs. non-AD classification experiments using clinical features and hippocampal volume as well as a comprehensive set of MRI features from across the brain. The best performance is achieved by incorporating additional important MRI features, which outperforms using hippocampal volume alone. Furthermore, we use the Boruta statistical approach to identify and visualize significant brain regions distinguishing between diagnostic groups. Our ML approach improves the percentage of correctly diagnosed atAD cases (the recall) from 52% to 69% for NACC and from 34% to 77% for ADNI, while achieving high precision. The proposed approach has important implications for improving diagnostic accuracy for non-amnestic atAD in clinical settings using only clinical testing battery and MRI.",

The platform is built on distributed, lightweight k3s clusters spanning heterogeneous, low-cost machines and interconnected through an encrypted overlay network, enabling cost-efficient resource pooling while enforcing container-based isolation and per-tenant data access controls. In addition, the platform integrates practical, platform-level defences against prompt injection attacks in RAG-based chatbots, translating insights from recent prompt injection research into deployable security mechanisms without requiring model retraining or enterprise-scale infrastructure. We evaluate the proposed platform through a real-world e-commerce deployment, demonstrating that secure and efficient LLM-based chatbot services can be achieved under realistic cost, operational, and security constraints faced by small businesses.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of traffic crash severity is critical for improving emergency response and public safety planning. Although recent large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their single-agent architectures often struggle with heterogeneous, domain-specific crash data and tend to generate biased or unstable predictions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes TransportAgents, a hybrid multi-agent framework that integrates category-specific LLM reasoning with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) integration module. Each specialized agent focuses on a particular subset of traffic information, such as demographics, environmental context, or incident details, to produce intermediate severity assessments that are subsequently fused into a unified prediction. Extensive experiments on two complementary U.S. datasets, the Consumer Product Safety Risk Management System (CPSRMS) and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), demonstrate that TransportAgents consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning and advanced LLM-based baselines. Across three representative backbones, including closed-source models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, as well as open-source models such as LLaMA-3.3, the framework exhibits strong robustness, scalability, and cross-dataset generalizability. A supplementary distributional analysis further shows that TransportAgents produces more balanced and well-calibrated severity predictions than standard single-agent LLM approaches, highlighting its interpretability and reliability for safety-critical decision support applications.",

To address this, we propose a novel approach that leverages the rich information in dorsal hand skin deformation, unlocked by recent advances in dense visual featurizers. We introduce a dual-stream delta encoder that learns pose by contrasting features from a dynamic hand with a baseline relaxed position. Our evaluation demonstrates that, using only cropped dorsal images, our method reduces the Mean Per Joint Angle Error (MPJAE) by 18% in self-occluded scenarios (fingers >=50% occluded) compared to state-of-the-art techniques that depend on the whole hand's geometry and large model backbones. Consequently, our method not only enhances the reliability of downstream tasks like index finger pinch and tap estimation in occluded scenarios but also unlocks new interaction paradigms, such as detecting isometric force for a surface \"click\" without visible movement while minimizing model size.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is happening at a rapid pace. To ensure fast and safe charging, complex communication is required between the vehicle and the charging station. In the globally used Combined Charging System (CCS), this communication is carried over the HomePlug Green PHY (HPGP) physical layer. However, HPGP is known to suffer from wireless leakage, which may expose this data link to nearby attackers.   In this paper, we examine active wireless attacks against CCS, and study the impact they can have. We present the first real-time Software-Defined Radio (SDR) implementation of HPGP, granting unprecedented access to the communications within the charging cables. We analyze the characteristics of 2,750 real-world charging sessions to understand the timing constraints for hijacking. Using novel techniques to increase the attacks' reliability, we design a robust wireless Man-in-the-Middle evaluation framework for CCS.   We demonstrate full control over TLS usage and CCS protocol version negotiation, including TLS stripping attacks. We investigate how real devices respond to safety-critical MitM attacks, which modify power delivery information, and found target vehicles to be highly permissive. First, we caused a vehicle to display charging power exceeding 900 kW on the dashboard, while receiving only 40 kW. Second, we remotely overcharged a vehicle, at twice the requested current for 17 seconds before the vehicle triggered the emergency shutdown. Finally, we propose a backwards-compatible, downgrade-proof protocol extension to mitigate the underlying vulnerabilities.",

    "abstract": "Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) remains an acute concern, contributing to the spread of misinformation and diminished public trust, particularly in high-risk domains. Among hallucination types, factuality is crucial, as it concerns a model's alignment with established world knowledge. Adversarial factuality, defined as the deliberate insertion of misinformation into prompts with varying levels of expressed confidence, tests a model's ability to detect and resist confidently framed falsehoods. Existing work lacks high-quality, domain-specific resources for assessing model robustness under such adversarial conditions, and no prior research has examined the impact of injected misinformation on long-form text factuality.   To address this gap, we introduce AdversaRiskQA, the first verified and reliable benchmark systematically evaluating adversarial factuality across Health, Finance, and Law. The benchmark includes two difficulty levels to test LLMs' defensive capabilities across varying knowledge depths. We propose two automated methods for evaluating the adversarial attack success and long-form factuality. We evaluate six open- and closed-source LLMs from the Qwen, GPT-OSS, and GPT families, measuring misinformation detection rates. Long-form factuality is assessed on Qwen3 (30B) under both baseline and adversarial conditions. Results show that after excluding meaningless responses, Qwen3 (80B) achieves the highest average accuracy, while GPT-5 maintains consistently high accuracy. Performance scales non-linearly with model size, varies by domains, and gaps between difficulty levels narrow as models grow. Long-form evaluation reveals no significant correlation between injected misinformation and the model's factual output. AdversaRiskQA provides a valuable benchmark for pinpointing LLM weaknesses and developing more reliable models for high-stakes applications.",

This conception of character places significant emphasis on the main character who is present in the most scenes. In this work, we instead adopt a framing developed from a new literary theory proposing a six-component structural model of character. This model enables a comprehensive approach to character that accounts for the narrator-character distinction and includes a component neglected by prior methods, discussion by other characters. We compare general-purpose LLMs with task-specific transformers for operationalizing this model of character on major 19th-century British realist novels. Our methods yield both component-level and graph representations of character discussion. We then demonstrate that these representations allow us to approach literary questions at scale from a new computational lens. Specifically, we explore Woloch's classic \"the one vs the many\" theory of character centrality and the gendered dynamics of character discussion.",

    "abstract": "Recent image generation models have shown impressive progress, yet they often struggle to yield controllable and consistent results when users attempt to edit specific elements within an existing image. Layered representations enable flexible, user-driven content creation, but existing approaches often fail to produce layers with coherent compositing relationships, and their object layers typically lack realistic visual effects such as shadows and reflections. To overcome these limitations, we propose LASAGNA, a novel, unified framework that generates an image jointly with its composing layers--a photorealistic background and a high-quality transparent foreground with compelling visual effects. Unlike prior work, LASAGNA efficiently learns correct image composition from a wide range of conditioning inputs--text prompts, foreground, background, and location masks--offering greater controllability for real-world applications. To enable this, we introduce LASAGNA-48K, a new dataset composed of clean backgrounds and RGBA foregrounds with physically grounded visual effects. We also propose LASAGNABENCH, the first benchmark for layer editing. We demonstrate that LASAGNA excels in generating highly consistent and coherent results across multiple image layers simultaneously, enabling diverse post-editing applications that accurately preserve identity and visual effects. LASAGNA-48K and LASAGNABENCH will be publicly released to foster open research in the community. The project page is https://rayjryang.github.io/LASAGNA-Page/.",

These models do not improve upon ViT with registers, highlighting the fact that these findings may be scale, domain, or application-specific.",

    "abstract": "The quantum hashing bound guarantees that rates up to $1-H(p_I, p_X, p_Y, p_Z)$ are achievable for memoryless Pauli channels, but it is not generally tight. A known way to improve achievable rates for certain asymmetric Pauli channels is to apply a small inner stabilizer code to a few channel uses, decode, and treat the resulting logical noise as an induced Pauli channel; reapplying the hashing argument to this induced channel can beat the baseline hashing bound. We generalize this induced-channel viewpoint to arbitrary stabilizer codes used purely as channel transforms. Given any $ [\\![ n, k ]\\!] $ stabilizer generator set, we construct a full symplectic tableau, compute the induced joint distribution of logical Pauli errors and syndromes under the physical Pauli channel, and obtain an achievable rate via a hashing bound with decoder side information. We perform a structured search over small transforms and report instances that improve the baseline hashing bound for a family of Pauli channels with skewed and independent errors studied in prior work.",

    "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics enables spatial gene expression profiling, motivating computational models that capture spatially conditioned regulatory relationships. We introduce SAGE-FM, a lightweight spatial transcriptomics foundation model based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) trained with a masked central spot prediction objective. Trained on 416 human Visium samples spanning 15 organs, SAGE-FM learns spatially coherent embeddings that robustly recover masked genes, with 91% of masked genes showing significant correlations (p < 0.05). The embeddings generated by SAGE-FM outperform MOFA and existing spatial transcriptomics methods in unsupervised clustering and preservation of biological heterogeneity. SAGE-FM generalizes to downstream tasks, enabling 81% accuracy in pathologist-defined spot annotation in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and improving glioblastoma subtype prediction relative to MOFA. In silico perturbation experiments further demonstrate that the model captures directional ligand-receptor and upstream-downstream regulatory effects consistent with ground truth. These results demonstrate that simple, parameter-efficient GCNs can serve as biologically interpretable and spatially aware foundation models for large-scale spatial transcriptomics.",

    "abstract": "Volunteer-led lake monitoring yields irregular, seasonal time series with many gaps arising from ice cover, weather-related access constraints, and occasional human errors, complicating forecasting and early warning of harmful algal blooms. We study Secchi Disk Depth (SDD) forecasting on a 30-lake, data-rich subset drawn from three decades of in situ records collected across Maine lakes. Missingness is handled via Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), and we evaluate performance with a normalized Mean Absolute Error (nMAE) metric for cross-lake comparability. Among six candidates, ridge regression provides the best mean test performance. Using ridge regression, we then quantify the minimal sample size, showing that under a backward, recent-history protocol, the model reaches within 5% of full-history accuracy with approximately 176 training samples per lake on average. We also identify a minimal feature set, where a compact four-feature subset matches the thirteen-feature baseline within the same 5% tolerance. Bringing these results together, we introduce a joint feasibility function that identifies the minimal training history and fewest predictors sufficient to achieve the target of staying within 5% of the complete-history, full-feature baseline. In our study, meeting the 5% accuracy target required about 64 recent samples and just one predictor per lake, highlighting the practicality of targeted monitoring. Hence, our joint feasibility strategy unifies recent-history length and feature choice under a fixed accuracy target, yielding a simple, efficient rule for setting sampling effort and measurement priorities for lake researchers.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, Rectified flow (RF) has gained considerable popularity largely due to its generation efficiency and state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we investigate the degree to which RF automatically adapts to the intrinsic low dimensionality of the support of the target distribution to accelerate sampling. We show that, using a carefully designed choice of the time-discretization scheme and with sufficiently accurate drift estimates, the RF sampler enjoys an iteration complexity of order $O(k/\\varepsilon)$ (up to log factors), where $\\varepsilon$ is the precision in total variation distance and $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of   the target distribution. In addition, we show that the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) procedure is equivalent to a stochastic version of RF by establishing a novel connection between these processes and stochastic localization. Building on this connection, we further design a stochastic RF sampler that also adapts to the low-dimensionality of the target distribution under milder requirements on the accuracy of the drift estimates, and also with a specific time schedule. We illustrate with simulations on the synthetic data and text-to-image data experiments the improved performance of the proposed samplers implementing the newly designed time-discretization schedules.",

    "abstract": "Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive large language model (LLM) inference by decoupling generation and verification. While recent methods improve draft quality by tightly coupling the drafter with the target model, the verification mechanism itself remains largely unchanged, relying on strict token-level rejection sampling. In practice, modern LLMs frequently operate in low-margin regimes where the target model exhibits weak preference among top candidates. In such cases, rejecting plausible runner-up tokens yields negligible information gain while incurring substantial rollback cost, leading to a fundamental inefficiency in verification. We propose Margin-Aware Speculative Verification, a training-free and domain-agnostic verification strategy that adapts to the target model's local decisiveness. Our method conditions verification on decision stability measured directly from the target logits and relaxes rejection only when strict verification provides minimal benefit. Importantly, the approach modifies only the verification rule and is fully compatible with existing target-coupled speculative decoding frameworks. Extensive experiments across model scales ranging from 8B to 235B demonstrate that our method delivers consistent and significant inference speedups over state-of-the-art baselines while preserving generation quality across diverse benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "A common solution for mitigating outdated or incorrect information in Large Language Models (LLMs) is to provide updated facts in-context or through knowledge editing. However, these methods introduce knowledge conflicts when the knowledge update fails to overwrite the model's parametric knowledge, which propagate to faulty reasoning. Current benchmarks for this problem, however, largely focus only on single knowledge updates and fact recall without evaluating how these updates affect downstream reasoning. In this work, we introduce TRACK (Testing Reasoning Amid Conflicting Knowledge), a new benchmark for studying how LLMs propagate new knowledge through multi-step reasoning when it conflicts with the model's initial parametric knowledge. Spanning three reasoning-intensive scenarios (WIKI, CODE, and MATH), TRACK introduces multiple, realistic conflicts to mirror real-world complexity. Our results on TRACK reveal that providing updated facts to models for reasoning can worsen performance compared to providing no updated facts to a model, and that this performance degradation exacerbates as more updated facts are provided. We show this failure stems from both inability to faithfully integrate updated facts, but also flawed reasoning even when knowledge is integrated. TRACK provides a rigorous new benchmark to measure and guide future progress on propagating conflicting knowledge in multi-step reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) libraries (e.g., PyTorch) are popular in AI development. These libraries are complex and contain bugs. Researchers have proposed various bug-finding techniques for such libraries. Yet, there is much room for improvement. A key challenge in testing DL libraries is the lack of API specifications. Prior testing approaches often inaccurately model the input specifications of DL APIs, resulting in missed valid inputs that could reveal bugs or false alarms due to invalid inputs.   To address this challenge, we develop Centaur -- the first neurosymbolic technique to test DL library APIs using dynamically learned input constraints. Centaur leverages the key idea that formal API constraints can be learned from a small number of automatically generated seed inputs, and that the learned constraints can be solved using SMT solvers to generate valid and diverse test inputs.   We develop a novel grammar that represents first-order logic formulae over API parameters and expresses tensor-related properties (e.g., shape, data types) as well as relational properties between parameters. We use the grammar to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) to enumerate syntactically correct candidate rules, validated using seed inputs. Further, we develop a custom refinement strategy to prune the set of learned rules to eliminate spurious or redundant rules. We use the learned constraints to systematically generate valid and diverse inputs by integrating SMT-based solving with randomized sampling.   We evaluate Centaur for testing PyTorch and TensorFlow. Our results show that Centaur's constraints have a recall of 94.0% and a precision of 94.0% on average. In terms of coverage, Centaur covers 203, 150, and 9,608 more branches than TitanFuzz, ACETest and Pathfinder, respectively. Using Centaur, we also detect 26 new bugs in PyTorch and TensorFlow, 18 of which are confirmed.",

    "abstract": "Bias in chest X-ray classifiers frequently stems from sex- and age-related shortcuts, leading to systematic underdiagnosis of minority subgroups. Previous pixel-space attribute neutralizers, which rely on convolutional encoders, lessen but do not fully remove this attribute leakage at clinically usable edit strengths. This study evaluates whether substituting the U-Net convolutional encoder with a Vision Transformer backbone in the Attribute-Neutral Framework can reduce demographic attribute leakage while preserving diagnostic accuracy. A data-efficient Image Transformer Small (DeiT-S) neutralizer was trained on the ChestX-ray14 dataset. Its edited images, generated across eleven edit-intensity levels, were evaluated with an independent AI judge for attribute leakage and with a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) for disease prediction. At a moderate edit level (alpha = 0.5), the Vision Transformer (ViT) neutralizer reduces patient sex-recognition area under the curve (AUC) to approximately 0.80, about 10 percentage points below the original framework's convolutional U-Net encoder, despite being trained for only half as many epochs. Meanwhile, macro receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) across 15 findings stays within five percentage points of the unedited baseline, and the worst-case subgroup AUC remains near 0.70. These results indicate that global self-attention vision models can further suppress attribute leakage without sacrificing clinical utility, suggesting a practical route toward fairer chest X-ray AI.",

MPT guides models to adopt contrasting social identities (e.g., male and female) along with a neutral viewpoint, and then engages these personas iteratively to expose and correct biases. Through a dialectical reasoning process, the framework transforms the potential weakness of persona assignment into a strength for bias mitigation. We evaluate MPT on two widely used bias benchmarks across both open-source and closed-source models of varying scales. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements over existing prompting-based strategies: MPT achieves the lowest bias while maintaining core reasoning ability.",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) toward multimodal, high-stakes enterprise applications has outpaced the development of domain specific evaluation benchmarks. Existing datasets often rely on general-domain corpora or purely textual retrieval, failing to capture the complexity of specialized technical documents where information is inextricably multimodal and reasoning requires synthesizing disjoint evidence. We address this gap by introducing MiRAGE, a Multiagent framework for RAG systems Evaluation, that leverages a collaborative swarm of specialized agents to generate verified, domain-specific, multimodal, and multi-hop Question-Answer datasets. MiRAGE orchestrates a swarm of specialized agents: a recursive context optimization loop to aggregate scattered evidence, an adversarial verifier agent to guarantee factual grounding, and an agent to recognize the expert persona and the relevant domain to mimic expert cognitive workflows. Extensive empirical evaluation across four distinct domains (regulations, finance, quantitative biology, and journalism) demonstrates that MiRAGE generates datasets with significantly higher reasoning complexity (>2.3 average hops) and factual faithfulness. Our ablation studies point that MiRAGE can be powered by LLMs if textual descriptions of the images are available. Visual grounding still remains a frontier. By automating the creation of gold standard evaluation datasets that reflect the latent thematic structure of proprietary corpora, MiRAGE provides the necessary infrastructure to rigorously benchmark the next generation information retrieval systems.",

Large language models (LLMs) can be advantageous if trained at scale on general knowledge, but especially and in particular when the training data includes information such as detailed map geography topology of the entire planet, as well as the ability to access real time situational data such as weather. However, challenges remain in the interface between drones and LLMs in general, with each application requiring a tedious, labor intensive effort to connect the LLM trained knowledge to drone command and control. Here, we solve that problem, using an interface strategy that is LLM agnostic and drone agnostic, providing the first universal, versatile, comprehensive and easy to use drone control interface. We do this using the new model context protocol (MCP) standard, an open standard that provides a universal way for AI systems to access external data, tools, and services. We develop and deploy a cloud based Linux machine hosting an MCP server that supports the Mavlink protocol, an ubiquitous drone control language used almost universally by millions of drones including Ardupilot and PX4 framework.We demonstrate flight control of a real unmanned aerial vehicle. In further testing, we demonstrate extensive flight planning and control capability in a simulated drone, integrated with a Google Maps MCP server for up to date, real time navigation information. This demonstrates a universal approach to integration of LLMs with drone command and control, a paradigm that leverages and exploits virtually all of modern AI industry with drone technology in an easy to use interface that translates natural language to drone control.",

    "abstract": "Federal research funding shapes the direction, diversity, and impact of the US scientific enterprise. Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly diffusing into scientific practice, holding substantial promise while raising widespread concerns. Despite growing attention to AI use in scientific writing and evaluation, little is known about how the rise of LLMs is reshaping the public funding landscape. Here, we examine LLM involvement at key stages of the federal funding pipeline by combining two complementary data sources: confidential National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) proposal submissions from two large US R1 universities, including funded, unfunded, and pending proposals, and the full population of publicly released NSF and NIH awards. We find that LLM use rises sharply beginning in 2023 and exhibits a bimodal distribution, indicating a clear split between minimal and substantive use. Across both private submissions and public awards, higher LLM involvement is consistently associated with lower semantic distinctiveness, positioning projects closer to recently funded work within the same agency. The consequences of this shift are agency-dependent. LLM use is positively associated with proposal success and higher subsequent publication output at NIH, whereas no comparable associations are observed at NSF. Notably, the productivity gains at NIH are concentrated in non-hit papers rather than the most highly cited work. Together, these findings provide large-scale evidence that the rise of LLMs is reshaping how scientific ideas are positioned, selected, and translated into publicly funded research, with implications for portfolio governance, research diversity, and the long-run impact of science.",

We find that semantic similarity between the two platforms decays across article sections and diverges more strongly on controversial topics than on randomly sampled ones.

    "abstract": "Standard autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) is inherently short-sighted, often failing to find globally optimal reasoning paths due to its token-by-token generation process. While inference-time strategies like foresight sampling attempt to mitigate this by simulating future steps, they typically rely on ad-hoc heuristics for valuing paths and pruning the search space. This paper introduces Martingale Foresight Sampling (MFS), a principled framework that reformulates LLM decoding as a problem of identifying an optimal stochastic process. By modeling the quality of a reasoning path as a stochastic process, we leverage Martingale theory to design a theoretically-grounded algorithm. Our approach replaces heuristic mechanisms with principles from probability theory: step valuation is derived from the Doob Decomposition Theorem to measure a path's predictable advantage, path selection uses Optional Stopping Theory for principled pruning of suboptimal candidates, and an adaptive stopping rule based on the Martingale Convergence Theorem terminates exploration once a path's quality has provably converged. Experiments on six reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MFS surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency.

    "abstract": "Emergency Department overcrowding is a critical issue that compromises patient safety and operational efficiency, necessitating accurate demand forecasting for effective resource allocation. This study evaluates and compares three distinct predictive models: Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors (SARIMAX), EXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for forecasting daily ED arrivals over a seven-day horizon. Utilizing data from an Australian tertiary referral hospital spanning January 2017 to December 2021, this research distinguishes itself by decomposing demand into eight specific ward categories and stratifying patients by clinical complexity. To address data distortions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the study employs the Prophet model to generate synthetic counterfactual values for the anomalous period. Experimental results demonstrate that all three proposed models consistently outperform a seasonal naive baseline. XGBoost demonstrated the highest accuracy for predicting total daily admissions with a Mean Absolute Error of 6.63, while the statistical SARIMAX model proved marginally superior for forecasting major complexity cases with an MAE of 3.77. The study concludes that while these techniques successfully reproduce regular day-to-day patterns, they share a common limitation in underestimating sudden, infrequent surges in patient volume.",

    "title": "Benchmarking LLMs for Pairwise Causal Discovery in Biomedical and Multi-Domain Contexts",
    "abstract": "The safe deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes fields like biomedicine, requires them to be able to reason about cause and effect. We investigate this ability by testing 13 open-source LLMs on a fundamental task: pairwise causal discovery (PCD) from text. Our benchmark, using 12 diverse datasets, evaluates two core skills: 1) \\textbf{Causal Detection} (identifying if a text contains a causal link) and 2) \\textbf{Causal Extraction} (pulling out the exact cause and effect phrases). We tested various prompting methods, from simple instructions (zero-shot) to more complex strategies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Few-shot In-Context Learning (FICL).   The results show major deficiencies in current models. The best model for detection, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, only achieved a mean score of 49.57\\% ($C_{detect}$), while the best for extraction, Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct, reached just 47.12\\% ($C_{extract}$). Models performed best on simple, explicit, single-sentence relations. However, performance plummeted for more difficult (and realistic) cases, such as implicit relationships, links spanning multiple sentences, and texts containing multiple causal pairs. We provide a unified evaluation framework, built on a dataset validated with high inter-annotator agreement ($κ\\ge 0.758$), and make all our data, code, and prompts publicly available to spur further research. \\href{https://github.com/sydneyanuyah/CausalDiscovery}{Code available here: https://github.com/sydneyanuyah/CausalDiscovery}",

    "title": "Equal-Pay Contracts",
    "abstract": "We study multi-agent contract design, where a principal incentivizes a team of agents to take costly actions that jointly determine the project success via a combinatorial reward function. While prior work largely focuses on unconstrained contracts that allow heterogeneous payments across agents, many real-world environments limit payment dispersion. Motivated by this, we study equal-pay contracts, where all agents receive identical payments. Our results also extend to nearly-equal-pay contracts where any two payments are identical up to a constant factor.   We provide both algorithmic and hardness results across a broad hierarchy of reward functions, under both binary and combinatorial action models. While we focus on equal-pay contracts, our analysis also yields new insights into unconstrained contract design, and resolves two important open problems. On the positive side, we design polynomial-time O(1)-approximation algorithms for (i) submodular rewards under combinatorial actions, and (ii) XOS rewards under binary actions. These guarantees are tight: We rule out the existence of (i) a PTAS for combinatorial actions, even for gross substitutes rewards (unless P = NP), and (ii) any O(1)-approximation for XOS rewards with combinatorial actions. Crucially, our hardness results hold even for unconstrained contracts, thereby settling the corresponding open problems in this setting.   Finally, we quantify the loss induced by fairness via the price of equality, defined as the worst-case ratio between the optimal principal's utility achievable by unconstrained contracts and that achievable by equal-pay contracts. We obtain a bound of $Θ(\\log n/ \\log \\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of agents. This gap is tight in a strong sense: the upper bound applies even for XOS rewards with combinatorial actions, while the lower bound arises already for additive rewards with binary actions.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines how to make large language models reliable for high-stakes legal work by reducing hallucinations. It distinguishes three AI paradigms: (1) standalone generative models (\"creative oracle\"), (2) basic retrieval-augmented systems (\"expert archivist\"), and (3) an advanced, end-to-end optimized RAG system (\"rigorous archivist\"). The authors introduce two reliability metrics -False Citation Rate (FCR) and Fabricated Fact Rate (FFR)- and evaluate 2,700 judicial-style answers from 12 LLMs across 75 legal tasks using expert, double-blind review. Results show that standalone models are unsuitable for professional use (FCR above 30%), while basic RAG greatly reduces errors but still leaves notable misgrounding. Advanced RAG, using techniques such as embedding fine-tuning, re-ranking, and self-correction, reduces fabrication to negligible levels (below 0.2%). The study concludes that trustworthy legal AI requires rigor-focused, retrieval-based architectures emphasizing verification and traceability, and provides an evaluation framework applicable to other high-risk domains.",

    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis from low dynamic range (LDR) blurry images, which are common in the wild, struggles to recover high dynamic range (HDR) and sharp 3D representations in extreme lighting conditions. Although existing methods employ event data to address this issue, they ignore the sensor-physics mismatches between the camera output and physical world radiance, resulting in suboptimal HDR and deblurring results. To cope with this problem, we propose a unified sensor-physics grounded NeRF framework for sharp HDR novel view synthesis from single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events. We employ NeRF to directly represent the actual radiance of the 3D scene in the HDR domain and model raw HDR scene rays hitting the sensor pixels as in the physical world. A pixel-wise RGB mapping field is introduced to align the above rendered pixel values with the sensor-recorded LDR pixel values of the input images. A novel event mapping field is also designed to bridge the physical scene dynamics and actual event sensor output. The two mapping fields are jointly optimized with the NeRF network, leveraging the spatial and temporal dynamic information in events to enhance the sharp HDR 3D representation learning. Experiments on the collected and public datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art deblurring HDR novel view synthesis results with single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events.",

    "title": "Multi-Targeted Graph Backdoor Attack",
    "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) have demonstrated exceptional performance in solving critical problems across diverse domains yet remain susceptible to backdoor attacks. Existing studies on backdoor attack for graph classification are limited to single target attack using subgraph replacement based mechanism where the attacker implants only one trigger into the GNN model. In this paper, we introduce the first multi-targeted backdoor attack for graph classification task, where multiple triggers simultaneously redirect predictions to different target labels. Instead of subgraph replacement, we propose subgraph injection which preserves the structure of the original graphs while poisoning the clean graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, where our attack achieves high attack success rates for all target labels with minimal impact on the clean accuracy. Experimental results on five dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our attack framework compared to the conventional subgraph replacement-based attack. Our analysis on four GNN models confirms the generalization capability of our attack which is effective regardless of the GNN model architectures and training parameters settings. We further investigate the impact of the attack design parameters including injection methods, number of connections, trigger sizes, trigger edge density and poisoning ratios. Additionally, our evaluation against state-of-the-art defenses (randomized smoothing and fine-pruning) demonstrates the robustness of our proposed multi-target attacks. This work highlights the GNN vulnerability against multi-targeted backdoor attack in graph classification task.

    "abstract": "Training modern deep learning models is increasingly constrained by GPU memory and compute limits. While Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra (RandNLA) offers proven techniques to compress these models, the lack of a unified, production-grade library prevents widely adopting these methods. We present Panther, a PyTorch-compatible library that consolidates established RandNLA algorithms into a single high-performance framework. Panther engineers efficient, drop-in replacements for standard components including sketched linear layers, 2D convolution, multi-head attention, and randomized matrix decompositions (such as pivoted CholeskyQR). By implementing a custom C++/CUDA backend (pawX), Panther provides an optimized implementation that can run on both CPUs and GPUs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RandNLA techniques and Panther's ease of adoption. By replacing standard PyTorch linear layers with Panther layers (requiring only a few lines of code) we achieve significant memory savings (up to 75%) on BERT while maintaining comparable loss.

Our aim is to complement and, thus, address issues of established measurement techniques that offer imprecise data for non-uniform movements (burned calories) or provide limited information on strain across different body parts (self-perception scales). We validate the reliability of XEM's measurements through a technical evaluation of ten participants and five exercises. Further, we assess the acceptance, usefulness, benefits, and opportunities of \\textit{XEM}$^{2}$ in an empirical user study. Our results show that \\textit{XEM}$^{2}$ provides reliable values of muscle work and supports participants in understanding their workout while also providing reliable information about perceived exertion per muscle group. With this paper, we introduce a novel system capable of measuring and visualizing exertion for single muscle groups, which has the potential to improve exercise monitoring to prevent unbalanced workouts.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider outlier embeddings into HSTs and ultrametrics. In particular, for $(X,d)$, let $k$ be the size of the smallest subset of $X$ such that all but that subset (i.e. the ``outlier set'') can be probabilistically embedded into the space of HSTs with expected distortion at most $c$. Our primary result is showing that there exists an efficient algorithm that takes in $(X,d)$ and a target distortion $c$ and samples from a probabilistic embedding with at most $O(\\frac k ε\\log^2k)$ outliers and distortion at most $(32+ε)c$, for any $ε>0$. This leads to better instance-specific approximations for certain instances of the buy-at-bulk and dial-a-ride problems, whose current best approximation algorithms go through HST embeddings.   In order to facilitate our results, we largely focus on the concept of compositions of nested embeddings introduced by [Chawla and Sheridan 2024]. A nested embedding is a composition of two embeddings of a metric space $(X,d)$ -- a low distortion embedding of a subset $S$ of nodes, and a higher distortion embedding of the entire metric. The composition is a single embedding that preserves the low distortion over $S$ and does not increase distortion over the remaining points by much. In this paper, we expand this concept from the setting of deterministic embeddings to the setting of probabilistic embeddings. We show how to find good nested compositions of embeddings into HSTs, and combine this with an approximation algorithm of [Munagala et al. 2023] to obtain our results.",

From review sites to court documents, ``natural'' content has been contaminated by data points that appear similar to natural data, but are in fact LLM-generated. In this work we revisit fundamental learning theory questions in this, now ubiquitous, setting. We model this scenario as a sequence of learning tasks where the input is a mix of natural and synthetic data, and the learning algorithms are oblivious to the origin of any individual example.   We study the possibilities and limitations of ERM in this setting. For the problem of estimating the mean of an arbitrary $d$-dimensional distribution, we find that while ERM converges to the true mean, it is outperformed by an algorithm that assigns non-uniform weights to examples from different generations of data. For the PAC learning setting, the disparity is even more stark. We find that ERM does not always converge to the true concept, echoing the model collapse literature. However, we show there are algorithms capable of learning the correct hypothesis for arbitrary VC classes and arbitrary amounts of contamination.",

    "abstract": "It is obvious that emotions are causal variables of motivation, as they elicit states, forces and energies that trigger and guide labor behavior. Thus, a motivational tension that is not informed by needs alone, but also by emotions, intention, goals and means to achieve them is therefore generated within the mental, emotional and physical plane. Based on Montserrat's opinion (2004: 131), that \"to motivate means, above all, to move and to transmit an emotion\", we will undertake to identify the mutual influences between emotions and motivation. The main objectives of this article are to display a summary of the theories and definitions about emotions and to explore the links between emotions and motivation. Although interconnected, emotions and motivation can be contemplated from a double perspective: (1) emotions influence motivation and (2) motivation influences emotions. Moreover, we will consider motivation from three dimensions: (1) cognitive, (2) affective and (3) volitional. The ultimate purpose of this article is to issue a warning as to the importance of the emotional side of motivation. An important part in implementing such insight is to be played by managers (and by employees, also), who should develop the skills and know-how needed to keep a well-balanced emotional climate that effectively favors the maximization of individual and group motivation at the workplace.",

This paper surveys the development and mathematical foundations, in particular, regarding bounds and constructions of rank-metric codes, emphasizing their extension beyond finite fields to more general settings. We examine Singleton-like bounds on code parameters, demonstrating their sharpness in finite field cases and contrasting this with contexts where the bounds are not tight. Furthermore, we discuss constructions of Maximum Rank Distance (MRD) codes over fields with cyclic Galois extensions and the relationship between linear rank-metric codes with systems and evasive subspaces. The paper also reviews results for algebraically closed fields and real numbers, previously appearing in the context of topology and measure theory.

By combining analytical modeling, real-time simulation, and machine learning, the framework offers a robust solution for ensuring safe robotic operations. An analytical model was developed to estimate the minimum distances between robotic arms based on their joint configurations, offering precise theoretical calculations that serve as both a validation tool and a benchmark. To complement this, a 3D simulation environment was created to model two 7-DOF Kinova robotic arms, generating a diverse dataset of configurations for collision detection and distance estimation. Using these insights, a deep neural network model was trained with joint actuators of robot arms and relative positions as inputs, achieving a mean absolute error of 282.2 mm and an R-squared value of 0.85. The close alignment between predicted and actual distances highlights the network's accuracy and its ability to generalize spatial relationships.

    "abstract": "The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the public health policy sector offers a transformative approach to navigating the vast repositories of regulatory guidance maintained by agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, the propensity for LLMs to generate hallucinations, defined as plausible but factually incorrect assertions, presents a critical barrier to the adoption of these technologies in high-stakes environments where information integrity is non-negotiable. This empirical evaluation explores the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures in mitigating these risks by grounding generative outputs in authoritative document context. Specifically, this study compares a baseline Vanilla LLM against Basic RAG and Advanced RAG pipelines utilizing cross-encoder re-ranking. The experimental framework employs a Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model and an all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model to process a corpus of official CDC policy analytical frameworks and guidance documents. The analysis measures the impact of two distinct chunking strategies, recursive character-based and token-based semantic splitting, on system accuracy, measured through faithfulness and relevance scores across a curated set of complex policy scenarios. Quantitative findings indicate that while Basic RAG architectures provide a substantial improvement in faithfulness (0.621) over Vanilla baselines (0.347), the Advanced RAG configuration achieves a superior faithfulness average of 0.797. These results demonstrate that two-stage retrieval mechanisms are essential for achieving the precision required for domain-specific policy question answering, though structural constraints in document segmentation remain a significant bottleneck for multi-step reasoning tasks.",

    "abstract": "In their 1991 paper \"Algebraic Reconstruction of Types and Effects,\" Pierre Jouvelot and David Gifford presented a type-and-effect reconstruction algorithm based on an algebraic structure of effects. Their work is considered a milestone in the development of type-and-effect systems, and has inspired numerous subsequent works in the area of static analysis. However, unlike the later research it spawned, the original algorithm considered a language with higher-rank polymorphism, a feature which is challenging to implement correctly. In this note, we identify subtle bugs related to variable binding in their approach to this feature. We revisit their type system and reconstruction algorithm, and describe the discovered issues.",

    "abstract": "Few-normal shot anomaly detection (FNSAD) aims to detect abnormal regions in images using only a few normal training samples, making the task highly challenging due to limited supervision and the diversity of potential defects. Recent approaches leverage vision-language models such as CLIP with prompt-based learning to align image and text features. However, existing methods often exhibit weak discriminability between normal and abnormal prompts and lack principled scoring mechanisms for patch-level anomalies. We propose a deviation-guided prompt learning framework that integrates the semantic power of vision-language models with the statistical reliability of deviation-based scoring. Specifically, we replace fixed prompt prefixes with learnable context vectors shared across normal and abnormal prompts, while anomaly-specific suffix tokens enable class-aware alignment. To enhance separability, we introduce a deviation loss with Top-K Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), modeling patch-level features as Gaussian deviations from the normal distribution. This allows the network to assign higher anomaly scores to patches with statistically significant deviations, improving localization and interpretability. Experiments on the MVTecAD and VISA benchmarks demonstrate superior pixel-level detection performance compared to PromptAD and other baselines. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of learnable prompts, deviation-based scoring, and the Top-K MIL strategy.",

    "abstract": "Reflexive Thematic Analysis (RTA) is a critical method for generating deep interpretive insights. Yet its core tenets, including researcher reflexivity, tangible analytical evolution, and productive disagreement, are often poorly supported by software tools that prioritize speed and consensus over interpretive depth. To address this gap, we introduce Reflexis, a collaborative workspace that centers these practices. It supports reflexivity by integrating in-situ reflection prompts, makes code evolution transparent and tangible, and scaffolds collaborative interpretation by turning differences into productive, positionality-aware dialogue. Results from our paired-analyst study (N=12) indicate that Reflexis encouraged participants toward more granular reflection and reframed disagreements as productive conversations. The evaluation also surfaced key design tensions, including a desire for higher-level, networked memos and more user control over the timing of proactive alerts. Reflexis contributes a design framework for tools that prioritize rigor and transparency to support deep, collaborative interpretation in an age of automation.",

The proposed formalism can be applied to represent logical formulas and probability distributions as structured tensor decompositions. This unified treatment identifies tensor network contractions as a fundamental inference class and formulates efficiently scaling reasoning algorithms, originating from probability theory and propositional logic, as contraction message passing schemes. The framework enables the definition and training of hybrid logical and probabilistic models, which we call Hybrid Logic Network.

    "abstract": "Internal activations of diffusion models encode rich semantic information, but interpreting such representations remains challenging. While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have shown promise in disentangling latent representations, existing SAE-based methods for diffusion model understanding rely on unsupervised approaches that fail to align sparse features with human-understandable concepts. This limits their ability to provide reliable semantic control over generated images. We introduce CASL (Concept-Aligned Sparse Latents), a supervised framework that aligns sparse latent dimensions of diffusion models with semantic concepts. CASL first trains an SAE on frozen U-Net activations to obtain disentangled latent representations, and then learns a lightweight linear mapping that associates each concept with a small set of relevant latent dimensions. To validate the semantic meaning of these aligned directions, we propose CASL-Steer, a controlled latent intervention that shifts activations along the learned concept axis. Unlike editing methods, CASL-Steer is used solely as a causal probe to reveal how concept-aligned latents influence generated content. We further introduce the Editing Precision Ratio (EPR), a metric that jointly measures concept specificity and the preservation of unrelated attributes. Experiments show that our method achieves superior editing precision and interpretability compared to existing approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve supervised alignment between latent representations and semantic concepts in diffusion models.",

Moving beyond single-agent prompting, we utilized LLM-based multi-agent systems to investigate complex social scenarios involving autistic and non-autistic agents. In our study, agents engaged in group-task conversations and answered structured interview questions, which we analyzed to examine ChatGPT's biases and how it conceptualizes autism. We found that ChatGPT assumes autistic people are socially dependent, which may affect how it interacts with autistic users or conveys information about autism. To address these challenges, we propose adopting the double empathy problem, which reframes communication breakdowns as a mutual challenge. We describe how future LLMs could address the biases we observed and improve interactions involving autistic people by incorporating the double empathy problem into their design.",

A key novelty in our approach is the use of LLM-as-a-judge, evaluation of sycophancy as a zero-sum game in a bet setting. Under this framework, sycophancy serves one individual (the user) while explicitly incurring cost on another. Comparing four leading models - Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGpt 4o, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411, and Claude Sonnet 3.7 - we find that while all models exhibit sycophantic tendencies in the common setting, in which sycophancy is self-serving to the user and incurs no cost on others, Claude and Mistral exhibit \"moral remorse\" and over-compensate for their sycophancy in case it explicitly harms a third party. Additionally, we observed that all models are biased toward the answer proposed last. Crucially, we find that these two phenomena are not independent; sycophancy and recency bias interact to produce `constructive interference' effect, where the tendency to agree with the user is exacerbated when the user's opinion is presented last.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) generate fluent answers but can struggle with trustworthy, domain-specific reasoning. We evaluate whether domain knowledge graphs (KGs) improve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for healthcare by constructing three PubMed-derived graphs: $\\mathbb{G}_1$ (T2DM), $\\mathbb{G}_2$ (Alzheimer's disease), and $\\mathbb{G}_3$ (AD+T2DM). We design two probes: Probe 1 targets merged AD T2DM knowledge, while Probe 2 targets the intersection of $\\mathbb{G}_1$ and $\\mathbb{G}_2$. Seven instruction-tuned LLMs are tested across retrieval sources {No-RAG, $\\mathbb{G}_1$, $\\mathbb{G}_2$, $\\mathbb{G}_1$ + $\\mathbb{G}_2$, $\\mathbb{G}_3$, $\\mathbb{G}_1$+$\\mathbb{G}_2$ + $\\mathbb{G}_3$} and three decoding temperatures. Results show that scope alignment between probe and KG is decisive: precise, scope-matched retrieval (notably $\\mathbb{G}_2$) yields the most consistent gains, whereas indiscriminate graph unions often introduce distractors that reduce accuracy. Larger models frequently match or exceed KG-RAG with a No-RAG baseline on Probe 1, indicating strong parametric priors, whereas smaller/mid-sized models benefit more from well-scoped retrieval. Temperature plays a secondary role; higher values rarely help. We conclude that precision-first, scope-matched KG-RAG is preferable to breadth-first unions, and we outline practical guidelines for graph selection, model sizing, and retrieval/reranking.

On MovieLens with LSTM, Lattice achieves +31.9% improvement over LSTM baseline in HR@10 (p < 3.29 x 10^-25, 30 seeds), outperforming transformer baselines by 109.4% over SASRec and 218.6% over BERT4Rec. On LIGO and financial data, the system correctly refuses archetype activation when distribution shift occurs - a successful outcome demonstrating confidence gating prevents false activation. On transformer backbones, Lattice provides 0.0% improvement (neutral, no degradation), gracefully deferring when structure is already present. This bidirectional validation - activating when patterns apply, refusing when they don't, and deferring when redundant - supports confidence gating as a promising architectural principle for managing epistemic uncertainty in safety-critical applications.",

Our method proceeds in two stages: first, we construct a decoupled latent space that captures localized motion patterns across different body parts using contrastive learning, enabling accurate and flexible motion retargeting even across robots with diverse morphologies. To enhance alignment between embodiments, we introduce tailored similarity metrics that combine joint rotation and end-effector positioning for critical segments, such as arms. Then, we train a goal-conditioned control policy directly within this latent space using only human data. Leveraging a conditional variational autoencoder, our policy learns to predict latent space displacements guided by intended goal directions. We show that the trained policy can be directly deployed on multiple robots without any adaptation. Furthermore, our method supports the efficient addition of new robots to the latent space by learning only a lightweight, robot-specific embedding layer. The learned latent policies can also be directly applied to the new robots. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables robust, scalable, and embodiment-agnostic robot control across a wide range of humanoid platforms.",

    "title": "DuFal: Dual-Frequency-Aware Learning for High-Fidelity Extremely Sparse-view CBCT Reconstruction",
    "abstract": "Sparse-view Cone-Beam Computed Tomography reconstruction from limited X-ray projections remains a challenging problem in medical imaging due to the inherent undersampling of fine-grained anatomical details, which correspond to high-frequency components. Conventional CNN-based methods often struggle to recover these fine structures, as they are typically biased toward learning low-frequency information. To address this challenge, this paper presents DuFal (Dual-Frequency-Aware Learning), a novel framework that integrates frequency-domain and spatial-domain processing via a dual-path architecture. The core innovation lies in our High-Local Factorized Fourier Neural Operator, which comprises two complementary branches: a Global High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that captures global frequency patterns and a Local High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that processes spatially partitioned patches to preserve spatial locality that might be lost in global frequency analysis. To improve efficiency, we design a Spectral-Channel Factorization scheme that reduces the Fourier Neural Operator parameter count. We also design a Cross-Attention Frequency Fusion module to integrate spatial and frequency features effectively. The fused features are then decoded through a Feature Decoder to produce projection representations, which are subsequently processed through an Intensity Field Decoding pipeline to reconstruct a final Computed Tomography volume. Experimental results on the LUNA16 and ToothFairy datasets demonstrate that DuFal significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in preserving high-frequency anatomical features, particularly under extremely sparse-view settings.",

We contribute an operational checklist to help guide the development and design of more trustworthy, safe, and user-friendly chatbots. The checklist serves as both a developmental framework and an auditing tool to ensure ethical and effective chatbot design.

CURE fine-tunes a multimodal instructional model on phrase grounding, grounded report generation, and anatomy-grounded report generation using public datasets. The method dynamically adjusts sampling based on model performance, emphasizing harder samples to improve spatial and textual alignment. CURE improves grounding accuracy by +0.37 IoU, boosts report quality by +0.188 CXRFEScore, and reduces hallucinations by 18.6%.

In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs for heterogeneous face recognition (HFR), where enrollment and probe images are from different sensing modalities, including visual (VIS), near infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and thermal camera. We benchmark multiple open-source MLLMs across several cross-modality scenarios, including VIS-NIR, VIS-SWIR, and VIS-THERMAL face recognition. The recognition performance of MLLMs is evaluated using biometric protocols and based on different metrics, including Acquire Rate, Equal Error Rate (EER), and True Accept Rate (TAR). Our results reveal substantial performance gaps between MLLMs and classical face recognition systems, particularly under challenging cross-spectral conditions, in spite of recent advances in MLLMs. Our findings highlight the limitations of current MLLMs for HFR and also the importance of rigorous biometric evaluation when considering their deployment in face recognition systems.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new family of polar-like codes, called Partially Polarized Polar (PPP) codes. PPP codes are constructed from conventional polar codes by selectively pruning polarization kernels, thereby modifying the synthesized bit-channel capacities to ensure a guaranteed number of non-frozen bits available early in decoding. These early-access information bits enable more effective early termination, which is particularly valuable for blind decoding in downlink control channels, where user equipment (UE) must process multiple candidates, many of which carry no valid control information. Our results show that PPP codes offer substantial performance gains over conventional polar codes, particularly at larger block lengths where hardware limitations restrict straightforward scaling. Compared with existing methods such as aggregation or segmentation, PPP codes achieve higher efficiency without the need for additional hardware support. Finally, we propose several frozen-bitmap design strategies tailored to PPP codes.",

    "abstract": "Homomorphic encryption (HE) enables arithmetic operations to be performed directly on encrypted data. It is essential for privacy-preserving applications such as machine learning, medical diagnosis, and financial data analysis. In popular HE schemes, ciphertext multiplication is only defined for two inputs. However, the multiplication of multiple inputs is needed in many HE applications. In our previous work, a three-input ciphertext multiplication method for the CKKS HE scheme was developed. This paper first reformulates the three-input ciphertext multiplication to enable the combination of computations in order to further reduce the complexity. The second contribution is extending the multiplication to multiple inputs without compromising the noise overhead. Additional evaluation keys are introduced to achieve relinearization of polynomial multiplication results. To minimize the complexity of the large number of rescaling units in the multiplier, a theoretical analysis is developed to relocate the rescaling, and a multi-level rescaling approach is proposed to implement combined rescaling with complexity similar to that of a single rescaling unit. Guidelines and examples are provided on the input partition to enable the combination of more rescaling. Additionally, efficient hardware architectures are designed to implement our proposed multipliers. The improved three-input ciphertext multiplier reduces the logic area and latency by 15% and 50%, respectively, compared to the best prior design. For multipliers with more inputs, ranging from 4 to 12, the architectural analysis reveals 32% savings in area and 45% shorter latency, on average, compared to prior work.",

Our core hypothesis is that surrogate models informed by attention-based embeddings of job telemetry can capture performance dynamics more effectively than standard regression techniques. We pair this with an intelligent sample acquisition strategy to ensure the approach is data-efficient. On two production HPC datasets, our embedding-informed method consistently identified higher-quality Pareto fronts of runtime-power trade-offs compared to baselines. Furthermore, our intelligent data sampling strategy drastically reduced training costs while improving the stability of the results. To our knowledge, this is the first work to successfully apply embedding-informed surrogates in a MOBO framework to the HPC scheduling problem, jointly optimizing for performance and power on production workloads.",

    "abstract": "The rapid emergence of new entities -- driven by cultural shifts, evolving trends, and personalized user data -- poses a significant challenge for existing Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs). While these models excel at general conversational tasks, their static training knowledge limits their ability to recognize domain-specific terms such as contact names, playlists, or technical jargon. Existing solutions primarily rely on prompting, which suffers from poor scalability: as the entity list grows, prompting encounters context window limitations, increased inference latency, and the \"lost-in-the-middle\" phenomenon. An alternative approach, Generative Error Correction (GEC), attempts to rewrite transcripts via post-processing but frequently suffers from \"over-correction\", introducing hallucinations of entities that were never spoken.   In this work, we introduce LOGIC (Logit-Space Integration for Contextual Biasing), an efficient and robust framework that operates directly in the decoding layer. Unlike prompting, LOGIC decouples context injection from input processing, ensuring constant-time complexity relative to prompt length. Extensive experiments using the Phi-4-MM model across 11 multilingual locales demonstrate that LOGIC achieves an average 9% relative reduction in Entity WER with a negligible 0.30% increase in False Alarm Rate.",

Second, we find that LLMs are state-blind: they focus on trait only, and produce similar responses regardless of state. Third, we find that reward models react to user state, but inconsistently: different models favor or penalize the same users in opposite directions. We release Chameleon to support research on affective computing, personalized dialogue, and RLHF alignment.",

Beyond performance, KD is also explored as a privacy-preserving mechanism to mitigate the risk of training data leakage. While training data memorization has been extensively studied in standard pre-training and fine-tuning settings, its dynamics in a knowledge distillation setup remain poorly understood. In this work, we study memorization across the KD pipeline using three large language model (LLM) families (Pythia, OLMo-2, Qwen-3) and three datasets (FineWeb, Wikitext, Nemotron-CC-v2). We find: (1) distilled models memorize significantly less training data than standard fine-tuning (reducing memorization by more than 50%); (2) some examples are inherently easier to memorize and account for a large fraction of memorization during distillation (over ~95%); (3) student memorization is predictable prior to distillation using features based on zlib entropy, KL divergence, and perplexity; and (4) while soft and hard distillation have similar overall memorization rates, hard distillation poses a greater risk: it inherits $2.7\\times$ more teacher-specific examples than soft distillation. Overall, we demonstrate that distillation can provide both improved generalization and reduced memorization risks compared to standard fine-tuning.",

These quantify how much information can be reliably transmitted when imposing the natural requirement that en- and decoding have to be computationally efficient. We focus on the computational two-way quantum capacity and showcase that it is closely related to the computational distillable entanglement of the Choi state of the channel. This connection allows us to show a stark computational capacity separation. Under standard cryptographic assumptions, there exists a quantum channel of polynomial complexity whose computational two-way quantum capacity vanishes while its unbounded counterpart is nearly maximal. More so, we show that there exists a sharp transition in computational quantum capacity from nearly maximal to zero when the channel complexity leaves the polynomial realm. Our results demonstrate that the natural requirement of computational efficiency can radically alter the limits of quantum communication.",

In this paper, we present FedUMM, a general federated learning framework for UMMs under non-IID multimodal data with low communication cost. Built on NVIDIA FLARE, FedUMM instantiates federation for a BLIP3o backbone via parameter-efficient fine-tuning: clients train lightweight LoRA adapters while freezing the foundation models, and the server aggregates only adapter updates. We evaluate on VQA v2 and the GenEval compositional generation benchmarks under Dirichlet-controlled heterogeneity with up to 16 clients. Results show slight degradation as client count and heterogeneity increase, while remaining competitive with centralized training. We further analyze computation--communication trade-offs and demonstrate that adapter-only federation reduces per-round communication by over an order of magnitude compared to full fine-tuning, enabling practical federated UMM training.

However, their further adoption is hindered by two coupled challenges: (i) the absence of standardized evaluation metrics makes it difficult to assess progress in the field and compare different approaches; and (ii) natural language descriptions are inherently underspecified, so multiple visualizations may be valid for the same query. To address these issues, we introduce VegaChat, a framework for generating, validating, and assessing declarative visualizations from natural language.   We propose two complementary metrics: Spec Score, a deterministic metric that measures specification-level similarity without invoking an LLM, and Vision Score, a library-agnostic, image-based metric that leverages a multimodal LLM to assess chart similarity and prompt compliance.   We evaluate VegaChat on the NLV Corpus and on the annotated subset of ChartLLM. VegaChat achieves near-zero rates of invalid or empty visualizations, while Spec Score and Vision Score exhibit strong correlation with human judgments (Pearson 0.65 and 0.71, respectively), indicating that the proposed metrics support consistent, cross-library comparison.

However, since real ground truth for face swapping is unavailable, achieving both accurate identity transfer and high-quality attribute preservation remains challenging. In addition, recent diffusion-based approaches attempt to improve visual fidelity through conditional inpainting on masked target images, but the masked condition removes crucial appearance cues of target, resulting in plausible yet misaligned attributes. To address these limitations, we propose APPLE (Attribute-Preserving Pseudo-Labeling), a diffusion-based teacher-student framework that enhances attribute fidelity through attribute-aware pseudo-label supervision. We reformulate face swapping as a conditional deblurring task to more faithfully preserve target-specific attributes such as lighting, skin tone, and makeup. In addition, we introduce an attribute-aware inversion scheme to further improve detailed attribute preservation. Through an elaborate attribute-preserving design for teacher learning, APPLE produces high-quality pseudo triplets that explicitly provide the student with direct face-swapping supervision. Overall, APPLE achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of attribute preservation and identity transfer, producing more photorealistic and target-faithful results.",

    "title": "Towards Understanding Best Practices for Quantization of Vision-Language Models",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive results for a variety of tasks, but state-of-the-art systems require fast GPUs with large amounts of memory. To reduce both the memory and latency of these systems, practitioners quantize their learned parameters, typically at half precision. A growing body of research focuses on preserving the model performance with more aggressive bit widths, and some work has been done to apply these strategies to other models, like vision transformers. In our study we investigate how a variety of quantization methods, including state-of-the-art GPTQ and AWQ, can be applied effectively to multimodal pipelines comprised of vision models, language models, and their connectors. We address how performance on captioning, retrieval, and question answering can be affected by bit width, quantization method, and which portion of the pipeline the quantization is used for. Results reveal that ViT and LLM exhibit comparable importance in model performance, despite significant differences in parameter size, and that lower-bit quantization of the LLM achieves high accuracy at reduced bits per weight (bpw). These findings provide practical insights for efficient deployment of MLLMs and highlight the value of exploration for understanding component sensitivities in multimodal models.

    "title": "Iterative Refinement Improves Compositional Image Generation",
    "abstract": "Text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable progress, yet they continue to struggle with complex prompts that require simultaneously handling multiple objects, relations, and attributes. Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline. Together, these findings highlight iterative self-correction as a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation.

    "title": "Walk through Paintings: Egocentric World Models from Internet Priors",
    "abstract": "What if a video generation model could not only imagine a plausible future, but the correct one, accurately reflecting how the world changes with each action? We address this question by presenting the Egocentric World Model (EgoWM), a simple, architecture-agnostic method that transforms any pretrained video diffusion model into an action-conditioned world model, enabling controllable future prediction. Rather than training from scratch, we repurpose the rich world priors of Internet-scale video models and inject motor commands through lightweight conditioning layers. This allows the model to follow actions faithfully while preserving realism and strong generalization. Our approach scales naturally across embodiments and action spaces, ranging from 3-DoF mobile robots to 25-DoF humanoids, where predicting egocentric joint-angle-driven dynamics is substantially more challenging. The model produces coherent rollouts for both navigation and manipulation tasks, requiring only modest fine-tuning. To evaluate physical correctness independently of visual appearance, we introduce the Structural Consistency Score (SCS), which measures whether stable scene elements evolve consistently with the provided actions. EgoWM improves SCS by up to 80 percent over prior state-of-the-art navigation world models, while achieving up to six times lower inference latency and robust generalization to unseen environments, including navigation inside paintings.",

Our method leverages a generative image-based light decomposition model that factorizes complex indoor scene illumination into its constituent light sources. This factorization enables independent manipulation of individual light sources, specifically allowing control over their state (on/off), chromaticity, and intensity. We further introduce multi-view lighting harmonization to ensure consistent propagation of the lighting decomposition across all scene views. This is integrated into a relightable 3D Gaussian splatting representation, providing real-time interactive control over the individual light sources. Our results demonstrate highly photorealistic lighting decomposition and relighting outcomes across diverse indoor scenes. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets and provide a quantitative and qualitative comparison to state-of-the-art techniques.

    "title": "Rethinking Video Generation Model for the Embodied World",
    "abstract": "Video generation models have significantly advanced embodied intelligence, unlocking new possibilities for generating diverse robot data that capture perception, reasoning, and action in the physical world. However, synthesizing high-quality videos that accurately reflect real-world robotic interactions remains challenging, and the lack of a standardized benchmark limits fair comparisons and progress. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive robotics benchmark, RBench, designed to evaluate robot-oriented video generation across five task domains and four distinct embodiments. It assesses both task-level correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible sub-metrics, including structural consistency, physical plausibility, and action completeness. Evaluation of 25 representative models highlights significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. Furthermore, the benchmark achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 with human evaluations, validating its effectiveness. While RBench provides the necessary lens to identify these deficiencies, achieving physical realism requires moving beyond evaluation to address the critical shortage of high-quality training data. Driven by these insights, we introduce a refined four-stage data pipeline, resulting in RoVid-X, the largest open-source robotic dataset for video generation with 4 million annotated video clips, covering thousands of tasks and enriched with comprehensive physical property annotations. Collectively, this synergistic ecosystem of evaluation and data establishes a robust foundation for rigorous assessment and scalable training of video models, accelerating the evolution of embodied AI toward general intelligence.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the overlooked challenge of stability and temporal consistency in interactive video generation, which synthesizes dynamic and controllable video worlds through interactive behaviors such as camera movements and text prompts. Despite remarkable progress in world modeling, current methods still suffer from severe instability and temporal degradation, often leading to spatial drift and scene collapse during long-horizon interactions. To better understand this issue, we initially investigate the underlying causes of instability and identify that the major source of error accumulation originates from the same scene, where generated frames gradually deviate from the initial clean state and propagate errors to subsequent frames. Building upon this observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, \\textbf{StableWorld}, a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism. By continuously filtering out degraded frames while retaining geometrically consistent ones, StableWorld effectively prevents cumulative drift at its source, leading to more stable and temporal consistency of interactive generation. Promising results on multiple interactive video models, \\eg, Matrix-Game, Open-Oasis, and Hunyuan-GameCraft, demonstrate that StableWorld is model-agnostic and can be applied to different interactive video generation frameworks to substantially improve stability, temporal consistency, and generalization across diverse interactive scenarios.",

This study introduces a real-time AI-facilitated multimodal feedback system that integrates structured textual explanations with dynamic multimedia resources, including the retrieved most relevant slide page references and streaming AI audio narration. In an online crowdsourcing experiment, we compared this system against fixed business-as-usual feedback by educators across three dimensions: (1) learning effectiveness, (2) learner engagement, (3) perceived feedback quality and value. Results showed that AI multimodal feedback achieved learning gains equivalent to original educator feedback while significantly outperforming it on perceived clarity, specificity, conciseness, motivation, satisfaction, and reducing cognitive load, with comparable correctness, trust, and acceptance. Process logs revealed distinct engagement patterns: for multiple-choice questions, educator feedback encouraged more submissions; for open-ended questions, AI-facilitated targeted suggestions lowered revision barriers and promoted iterative improvement. These findings highlight the potential of AI multimodal feedback to provide scalable, real-time, and context-aware support that both reduces instructor workload and enhances student experience.",

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to chemistry, tackling tasks such as molecular name conversion, captioning, text-guided generation, and property or reaction prediction. Most existing benchmarks emphasize general chemical knowledge, rely on literature or surrogate labels that risk leakage or bias, or reduce evaluation to multiple-choice questions. We introduce MolecularIQ, a molecular structure reasoning benchmark focused exclusively on symbolically verifiable tasks. MolecularIQ enables fine-grained evaluation of reasoning over molecular graphs and reveals capability patterns that localize model failures to specific tasks and molecular structures. This provides actionable insights into the strengths and limitations of current chemistry LLMs and guides the development of models that reason faithfully over molecular structure.",

Applying this framework to 162,965 TikTok videos and 814,825 images about social anxiety disorder (SAD), we find that facial expressions outperform textual sentiment in predicting viewership, informational content drives more attention than emotional support, and cross-modal synergies exhibit threshold-dependent effects.

Methodologically, we contribute a reproducible framework for interpretable multimodal research applicable across domains; substantively, we advance understanding of mental health communication in algorithmically mediated environments.",

    "title": "Robust Fake News Detection using Large Language Models under Adversarial Sentiment Attacks",
    "abstract": "Misinformation and fake news have become a pressing societal challenge, driving the need for reliable automated detection methods. Prior research has highlighted sentiment as an important signal in fake news detection, either by analyzing which sentiments are associated with fake news or by using sentiment and emotion features for classification. However, this poses a vulnerability since adversaries can manipulate sentiment to evade detectors especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs). A few studies have explored adversarial samples generated by LLMs, but they mainly focus on stylistic features such as writing style of news publishers. Thus, the crucial vulnerability of sentiment manipulation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of state-of-the-art fake news detectors under sentiment manipulation. We introduce AdSent, a sentiment-robust detection framework designed to ensure consistent veracity predictions across both original and sentiment-altered news articles. Specifically, we (1) propose controlled sentiment-based adversarial attacks using LLMs, (2) analyze the impact of sentiment shifts on detection performance. We show that changing the sentiment heavily impacts the performance of fake news detection models, indicating biases towards neutral articles being real, while non-neutral articles are often classified as fake content. (3) We introduce a novel sentiment-agnostic training strategy that enhances robustness against such perturbations. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AdSent significantly outperforms competitive baselines in both accuracy and robustness, while also generalizing effectively to unseen datasets and adversarial scenarios.",

We find that prior (absolute or relative) encoding schemes for multi-view attention do not meet the above desiderata, and present RayRoPE to address this gap. RayRoPE represents patch positions based on associated rays but leverages a predicted point along the ray instead of the direction for a geometry-aware encoding. To achieve SE(3) invariance, RayRoPE computes query-frame projective coordinates for computing multi-frequency similarity. Lastly, as the 'predicted' 3D point along a ray may not be precise, RayRoPE presents a mechanism to analytically compute the expected position encoding under uncertainty. We validate RayRoPE on the tasks of novel-view synthesis and stereo depth estimation and show that it consistently improves over alternate position encoding schemes (e.g. 15% relative improvement on LPIPS in CO3D). We also show that RayRoPE can seamlessly incorporate RGB-D input, resulting in even larger gains over alternatives that cannot positionally encode this information.",

    "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts layers achieve compute efficiency through weight sparsity: each token activates only a subset of experts. Data sparsity, where each expert processes only a subset of tokens, offers a complementary axis. Expert-choice routing implements data sparsity directly but violates causality in autoregressive models, creating train-inference mismatch. We recover data sparsity within causal token-choice MoE by leveraging zero-compute (null) experts within the routing pool. When a token routes to null experts, those slots consume no compute. The standard load balancing objective trains the model to uniformly use all experts (real and null) therefore creating data sparsity in expectation without the causality violations. We evaluate on vision-language model training, where data heterogeneity is pronounced: vision encoders produce many low-information tokens while text tokens are denser. At matched expected FLOPs, composing weight and data sparsity yields a more compute-efficient frontier than weight sparsity alone, with gains in training loss and downstream performance. The model learns implicit modality-aware allocation, routing vision tokens to null experts more aggressively than text, without explicit modality routing.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a family of advanced vision encoder, named OpenVision 3, that learns a single, unified visual representation that can serve both image understanding and image generation. Our core architecture is simple: we feed VAE-compressed image latents to a ViT encoder and train its output to support two complementary roles. First, the encoder output is passed to the ViT-VAE decoder to reconstruct the original image, encouraging the representation to capture generative structure. Second, the same representation is optimized with contrastive learning and image-captioning objectives, strengthening semantic features. By jointly optimizing reconstruction- and semantics-driven signals in a shared latent space, the encoder learns representations that synergize and generalize well across both regimes. We validate this unified design through extensive downstream evaluations with the encoder frozen. For multimodal understanding, we plug the encoder into the LLaVA-1.5 framework: it performs comparably with a standard CLIP vision encoder (e.g., 62.4 vs 62.2 on SeedBench, and 83.7 vs 82.9 on POPE). For generation, we test it under the RAE framework: ours substantially surpasses the standard CLIP-based encoder (e.g., gFID: 1.89 vs 2.54 on ImageNet). We hope this work can spur future research on unified modeling.",

    "abstract": "Perception is a cornerstone of autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to understand their surroundings and make safe, reliable decisions. Developing robust perception algorithms requires large-scale, high-quality datasets that cover diverse driving conditions and support thorough evaluation. Existing datasets often lack a high-fidelity digital twin, limiting systematic testing, edge-case simulation, sensor modification, and sim-to-real evaluations. To address this gap, we present DrivIng, a large-scale multimodal dataset with a complete geo-referenced digital twin of a ~18 km route spanning urban, suburban, and highway segments. Our dataset provides continuous recordings from six RGB cameras, one LiDAR, and high-precision ADMA-based localization, captured across day, dusk, and night. All sequences are annotated at 10 Hz with 3D bounding boxes and track IDs across 12 classes, yielding ~1.2 million annotated instances. Alongside the benefits of a digital twin, DrivIng enables a 1-to-1 transfer of real traffic into simulation, preserving agent interactions while enabling realistic and flexible scenario testing. To support reproducible research and robust validation, we benchmark DrivIng with state-of-the-art perception models and publicly release the dataset, digital twin, HD map, and codebase.",

    "abstract": "We study a distributed facility location problem in which a set of agents, each with a private position on the real line, is partitioned into a collection of fixed, disjoint groups. The goal is to open $k$ facilities at locations chosen from the set of positions reported by the agents. This decision is made by mechanisms that operate in two phases. In Phase 1, each group selects the position of one of its agents to serve as the group's representative location. In Phase 2, $k$ representatives are chosen as facility locations. Once the facility locations are determined, each agent incurs an individual cost, defined either as the sum of its distances to all facilities (sum-variant) or as the distance to its farthest facility (max-variant). We focus on the class of strategyproof mechanisms, which preclude the agents from benefiting through strategic misreporting, and establish tight bounds on the approximation ratio with respect to the social cost (the total individual agent cost) in both variants.",

Under appropriate regularity conditions, the problem can be cast as an instrumental variable (IV) regression with the environment acting as a (possibly high-dimensional) instrument. When there are many environments but only a few observations per environment, standard two-sample IV estimators fail to be consistent. We propose a GMM-type estimator based on cross-fold sample splitting of the instrument-covariate sample and prove that it is consistent as the number of environments grows but the sample size per environment remains constant. We further extend the method to sparse causal effects via $\\ell_1$-regularized estimation and post-selection refitting.",

However, little attention has been given to how these models perform when numerical expressions deviate from the prevailing conventions present in their training corpora. In this work, we investigate numerical reasoning across a wide range of numeral scripts and formats. We show that LLM accuracy drops substantially when numerical inputs are rendered in underrepresented scripts or formats, despite the underlying mathematical reasoning being identical. We further demonstrate that targeted prompting strategies, such as few-shot prompting and explicit numeral mapping, can greatly narrow this gap. Our findings highlight an overlooked challenge in multilingual numerical reasoning and provide actionable insights for working with LLMs to reliably interpret, manipulate, and generate numbers across diverse numeral scripts and formatting styles.",

    "abstract": "Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) from monocular RGB images is a fundamental yet challenging task due to the inherent ambiguity of inferring occluded 3D geometry from a single view. While feed-forward methods have made progress, they often struggle to generate plausible details in occluded regions and preserve the fundamental spatial relationships of objects. Such accurate generative reasoning capability for the entire 3D space is critical in real-world applications. In this paper, we present FlowSSC, the first generative framework applied directly to monocular semantic scene completion. FlowSSC treats the SSC task as a conditional generation problem and can seamlessly integrate with existing feed-forward SSC methods to significantly boost their performance. To achieve real-time inference without compromising quality, we introduce Shortcut Flow-matching that operates in a compact triplane latent space. Unlike standard diffusion models that require hundreds of steps, our method utilizes a shortcut mechanism to achieve high-fidelity generation in a single step, enabling practical deployment in autonomous systems. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI demonstrate that FlowSSC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning and artificial intelligence conferences such as NeurIPS and ICML now regularly receive tens of thousands of submissions, posing significant challenges to maintaining the quality and consistency of the peer review process. This challenge is particularly acute for best paper awards, which are an important part of the peer review process, yet whose selection has increasingly become a subject of debate in recent years. In this paper, we introduce an author-assisted mechanism to facilitate the selection of best paper awards. Our method employs the Isotonic Mechanism for eliciting authors' assessments of their own submissions in the form of a ranking, which is subsequently utilized to adjust the raw review scores for optimal estimation of the submissions' ground-truth quality. We demonstrate that authors are incentivized to report truthfully when their utility is a convex additive function of the adjusted scores, and we validate this convexity assumption for best paper awards using publicly accessible review data of ICLR from 2019 to 2023 and NeurIPS from 2021 to 2023. Crucially, in the special case where an author has a single quota -- that is, may nominate only one paper -- we prove that truthfulness holds even when the utility function is merely nondecreasing and additive. This finding represents a substantial relaxation of the assumptions required in prior work. For practical implementation, we extend our mechanism to accommodate the common scenario of overlapping authorship. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our mechanism significantly improves the quality of papers selected for awards.",

Our three-stage pipeline combines LLM extraction with supporting quotes, embedding-based semantic mapping to taxonomy categories, and LLM-as-a-judge validation that filters spurious assignments. To evaluate our approach, we extract 10,688 risk factors from S&P 500 companies and examine risk profile similarity across industry clusters. Beyond extraction, we introduce autonomous taxonomy maintenance where an AI agent analyzes evaluation feedback to identify problematic categories, diagnose failure patterns, and propose refinements, achieving 104.7% improvement in embedding separation in a case study. External validation confirms the taxonomy captures economically meaningful structure: same-industry companies exhibit 63% higher risk profile similarity than cross-industry pairs (Cohen's d=1.06, AUC 0.82, p<0.001). The methodology generalizes to any domain requiring taxonomy-aligned extraction from unstructured text, with autonomous improvement enabling continuous quality maintenance and enhancement as systems process more documents.",

Even when relevant information exists in the corpus, truncation can prevent compatible evidence from co-occurring, leading to failures that are not captured by relevance-based evaluation. This paper studies retrieval from a structural perspective, modeling query answering as a feasibility problem under truncation.   We formalize retrieval as a sequence of candidate evidence sets and characterize conditions under which feasibility in the limit implies feasibility at finite retrieval depth. We show that monotone truncation suffices to guarantee finite witnessability for individual queries. For classes of queries, we identify finite generation of witness certificates as the additional condition required to obtain a uniform retrieval bound, and we show that this condition is necessary. We further exhibit sharp counterexamples demonstrating failure under non-monotone truncation, non-finitely-generated query classes, and purely slotwise coverage.   Together, these results isolate feasibility preservation as a correctness criterion for retrieval independent of relevance scoring or optimization, and clarify structural limitations inherent to truncation-based retrieval.",

A standardized and unified toolkit that supports the fair benchmarking and comparison of competing solutions with not just common databases, protocols, metrics, but also a shared codebase, is missing. To address this, we propose WeDefense, the first open-source toolkit to support both fake audio detection and localization. Beyond model training, WeDefense emphasizes critical yet often overlooked components: flexible input and augmentation, calibration, score fusion, standardized evaluation metrics, and analysis tools for deeper understanding and interpretation. The toolkit is publicly available at https://github.com/zlin0/wedefense with interactive demos for fake audio detection and localization.",

We develop multi-context principal component analysis (MCPCA), a theoretical and algorithmic framework that decomposes data into factors shared across subsets of contexts. Applied to gene expression, MCPCA reveals axes of variation shared across subsets of cancer types and an axis whose variability in tumor cells, but not mean, is associated with lung cancer progression. Applied to contextualized word embeddings from language models, MCPCA maps stages of a debate on human nature, revealing a discussion between science and fiction over decades. These axes are not found by combining data across contexts or by restricting to individual contexts. MCPCA is a principled generalization of PCA to address the challenge of understanding factors underlying data across contexts.",

Across four controlled experiments, we show that metadata conditioning consistently improves in-region performance without sacrificing cross-region generalization, enables global models to recover localization comparable to region-specific models, and improves learning efficiency. Our ablation studies demonstrate that URL-level metadata alone captures much of the geographic signal, while balanced regional data coverage remains essential, as metadata cannot fully compensate for missing regions. Finally, we introduce a downstream benchmark of 800 localized news MCQs and show that after instruction tuning, metadata conditioned global models achieve accuracy comparable to LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct, despite being trained on substantially less data. Together, these results establish metadata conditioning as a practical and compute-efficient approach for localization of language models.",

    "abstract": "Cervical spine fractures are critical medical conditions requiring precise and efficient detection for effective clinical management. This study explores the viability of 2D projection-based vertebra segmentation for vertebra-level fracture detection in 3D CT volumes, presenting an end-to-end pipeline for automated analysis of cervical vertebrae (C1-C7). By approximating a 3D volume through optimized 2D axial, sagittal, and coronal projections, regions of interest are identified using the YOLOv8 model from all views and combined to approximate the 3D cervical spine area, achieving a 3D mIoU of 94.45 percent. This projection-based localization strategy reduces computational complexity compared to traditional 3D segmentation methods while maintaining high performance. It is followed by a DenseNet121-Unet-based multi-label segmentation leveraging variance- and energy-based projections, achieving a Dice score of 87.86 percent. Strategic approximation of 3D vertebral masks from these 2D segmentation masks enables the extraction of individual vertebra volumes. The volumes are analyzed for fractures using an ensemble of 2.5D Spatio-Sequential models incorporating both raw slices and projections per vertebra for complementary evaluation. This ensemble achieves vertebra-level and patient-level F1 scores of 68.15 and 82.26, and ROC-AUC scores of 91.62 and 83.04, respectively. We further validate our approach through an explainability study that provides saliency map visualizations highlighting anatomical regions relevant for diagnosis, and an interobserver variability analysis comparing our model's performance with expert radiologists, demonstrating competitive results.",

To understand the bugs encountered during agent development, we present the first comprehensive study of bug types, root causes, and effects in LLM agent-based software. We collected and analyzed 1,187 bug-related posts and code snippets from Stack Overflow, GitHub, and Hugging Face forums, focused on LLM agents built with seven widely used LLM frameworks as well as custom implementations. For a deeper analysis, we have also studied the component where the bug occurred, along with the programming language and framework. This study also investigates the feasibility of automating bug identification. For that, we have built a ReAct agent named BugReAct, equipped with adequate external tools to determine whether it can detect and annotate the bugs in our dataset.

Experiments on 14 VLMs show that most models are not yet ready for task progress estimation, exhibiting sensitivity to demonstration modality and viewpoint changes, as well as poor handling of unanswerable cases. While training-free prompting that enforces structured progress reasoning yields limited and model-dependent gains, the training-based ProgressLM-3B achieves consistent improvements even at a small model scale, despite being trained on a task set fully disjoint from the evaluation tasks.

    "abstract": "Autonomous drone racing represents a major frontier in robotics research. It requires an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can run on board light-weight flying robots under tight resource and time constraints, while pushing the physical system to its limits. The state of the art in this area consists of a system with a stereo camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that beat human drone racing champions in a controlled indoor environment. Here, we present MonoRace: an onboard drone racing approach that uses a monocular, rolling-shutter camera and IMU that generalizes to a competition environment without any external motion tracking system. The approach features robust state estimation that combines neural-network-based gate segmentation with a drone model. Moreover, it includes an offline optimization procedure that leverages the known geometry of gates to refine any state estimation parameter. This offline optimization is based purely on onboard flight data and is important for fine-tuning the vital external camera calibration parameters. Furthermore, the guidance and control are performed by a neural network that foregoes inner loop controllers by directly sending motor commands. This small network runs on the flight controller at 500Hz. The proposed approach won the 2025 Abu Dhabi Autonomous Drone Racing Competition (A2RL), outperforming all competing AI teams and three human world champion pilots in a direct knockout tournament.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in 3D object generation using diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, but generating realistic 3D urban scenes remains challenging. Existing methods relying solely on 3D diffusion models tend to suffer a degradation in appearance details, while those utilizing only 2D diffusion models typically compromise camera controllability. To overcome this limitation, we propose ScenDi, a method for urban scene generation that integrates both 3D and 2D diffusion models. We first train a 3D latent diffusion model to generate 3D Gaussians, enabling the rendering of images at a relatively low resolution. To enable controllable synthesis, this 3DGS generation process can be optionally conditioned by specifying inputs such as 3d bounding boxes, road maps, or text prompts. Then, we train a 2D video diffusion model to enhance appearance details conditioned on rendered images from the 3D Gaussians. By leveraging the coarse 3D scene as guidance for 2D video diffusion, ScenDi generates desired scenes based on input conditions and successfully adheres to accurate camera trajectories. Experiments on two challenging real-world datasets, Waymo and KITTI-360, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

    "abstract": "We identify a novel phenomenon in language models: benign fine-tuning of frontier models can lead to privacy collapse. We find that diverse, subtle patterns in training data can degrade contextual privacy, including optimisation for helpfulness, exposure to user information, emotional and subjective dialogue, and debugging code printing internal variables, among others. Fine-tuned models lose their ability to reason about contextual privacy norms, share information inappropriately with tools, and violate memory boundaries across contexts. Privacy collapse is a ``silent failure'' because models maintain high performance on standard safety and utility benchmarks whilst exhibiting severe privacy vulnerabilities. Our experiments show evidence of privacy collapse across six models (closed and open weight), five fine-tuning datasets (real-world and controlled data), and two task categories (agentic and memory-based). Our mechanistic analysis reveals that privacy representations are uniquely fragile to fine-tuning, compared to task-relevant features which are preserved. Our results reveal a critical gap in current safety evaluations, in particular for the deployment of specialised agents.",

In this paper, we give an axiomatic characterization for both the (match-)language equivalence and the largest substitution-closed equivalence that is sound for the (match-)language equivalence. To achieve this, we introduce a variant of propositional dynamic logic (PDL) on finite linear orders, extended with two operators: the restriction to the identity relation and the restriction to its complement. Our main contribution is a sound and complete Hilbert-style finite axiomatization for the logic, which captures the equivalences of REwLA. Using the extended operators, the completeness is established via a reduction into an identity-free variant of PDL on finite strict linear orders. Moreover, the extended PDL has the same computational complexity as REwLA.",

We investigate how real-time facial communication influences cooperation in repeated social dilemmas. In a laboratory experiment, participants play a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game under two conditions: in one, they observe their counterpart's facial expressions via gender-neutral avatars, and in the other no facial cues are available. Using state-of-the-art biometric technology to capture and display emotions in real-time, we find that facial communication significantly increases overall cooperation and, notably, promotes cooperation following defection. This restorative effect suggests that facial expressions help participants interpret defections less harshly, fostering forgiveness and the resumption of cooperation. While past actions remain the strongest predictor of behavior, our findings highlight the communicative power of facial expressions in shaping strategic outcomes. These results offer practical insights for designing emotionally responsive virtual agents and digital platforms that sustain cooperation in the absence of physical presence.",

The touch method was navigated through an LLM-powered \"task prompter,\" which integrated the user's history and smart environment to suggest contextually-appropriate commands. Quantitative results showed no significant differences across both spoken English conditions vs LLM-assisted touch. Qualitative results showed variability in opinions on the usability of each method. Ultimately, it will be necessary to have robust deaf-accented speech recognized natively by IPAs.",

    "abstract": "Why do even the most powerful 7B-parameter embedding models struggle with simple retrieval tasks that the decades old BM25 handles with ease? Recent theory suggests that this happens because of a dimensionality bottleneck. This occurs when we force infinite linguistic nuances into small, fixed-length learned vectors. We developed NUMEN to break this bottleneck by removing the learning process entirely. Instead of training heavy layers to map text to a constrained space, NUMEN uses deterministic character hashing to project language directly onto high-dimensional vectors. This approach requires no training, supports an unlimited vocabulary, and allows the geometric capacity scale as needed. On the LIMIT benchmark, NUMEN achieves 93.90 % Recall@100 at 32,768 dimensions. This makes it the first dense retrieval model to officially surpass the sparse BM25 baseline 93.6 %. Our findings show that the real problem in dense retrieval isn't the architecture, but the embedding layer itself. The solution isn't necessarily smarter training, but simply providing more room to breathe.",

This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of five CNN architectures (EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, DenseNet201, MobileNetV3, VGG16), five Transformer-based models (ViT, ConvTransformer, PatchTransformer, MLP-Mixer, SimpleTransformer), and a proposed hybrid model named Evan_V2. All models were evaluated on a four-class AD classification task comprising Mild Dementia, Moderate Dementia, Non-Demented, and Very Mild Dementia categories. Experimental findings show that CNN architectures consistently achieved strong performance, with ResNet50 attaining 98.83% accuracy. Transformer models demonstrated competitive generalization capabilities, with ViT achieving the highest accuracy among them at 95.38%. However, individual Transformer variants exhibited greater class-specific instability. The proposed Evan_V2 hybrid model, which integrates outputs from ten CNN and Transformer architectures through feature-level fusion, achieved the best overall performance with 99.99% accuracy, 0.9989 F1-score, and 0.9968 ROC AUC. Confusion matrix analysis further confirmed that Evan_V2 substantially reduced misclassification across all dementia stages, outperforming every standalone model. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid ensemble strategies in producing highly reliable and clinically meaningful diagnostic tools for Alzheimers disease classification.",

BMPv2 surpasses state-of-the-art by 1.5 average precision (AP) points on COCO and 6 AP points on OCHuman, becoming the first method to exceed 50 AP on OCHuman. We demonstrate that BMP's 2D prompting of 3D model improves 3D pose estimation in crowded scenes and that advances in 2D pose quality directly benefit 3D estimation.

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise in robot manipulation but often struggle to generalize to new instructions or complex multi-task scenarios. We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose BayesianVLA, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \\mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $π(a \\mid v, \\ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, BayesianVLA significantly improves generalization. Extensive experiments across on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate substantial gains, including an 11.3% improvement on the challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, validating the ability of our approach to robustly ground language in action.",

    "abstract": "AI coding agents are now submitting pull requests (PRs) to software projects, acting not just as assistants but as autonomous contributors. As these agentic contributions are rapidly increasing across real repositories, little is known about how they behave in practice and why many of them fail to be merged. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale study of 33k agent-authored PRs made by five coding agents across GitHub. (RQ1) We first quantitatively characterize merged and not-merged PRs along four broad dimensions: 1) merge outcomes across task types, 2) code changes, 3) CI build results, and 4) review dynamics. We observe that tasks related to documentation, CI, and build update achieve the highest merge success, whereas performance and bug-fix tasks perform the worst. Not-merged PRs tend to involve larger code changes, touch more files, and often do not pass the project's CI/CD pipeline validation. (RQ2) To further investigate why some agentic PRs are not merged, we qualitatively analyze 600 PRs to derive a hierarchical taxonomy of rejection patterns. This analysis complements the quantitative findings in RQ1 by uncovering rejection reasons not captured by quantitative metrics, including lack of meaningful reviewer engagement, duplicate PRs, unwanted feature implementations, and agent misalignment. Together, our findings highlight key socio-technical and human-AI collaboration factors that are critical to improving the success of future agentic workflows.",

Next, we formulate the problem of estimating entropy as a problem of estimating the average degree of a graph with the binary entropy function as its connection function.

Despite successful applications of generative AI in many programming languages, there are hardly any systematic analyses of ABAP code generation to date. The aim of the study is to empirically analyze to what extent various LLMs can generate syntactically correct and functional ABAP code, how effectively they use compiler feedback for iterative improvement, and which task types pose special challenges. For this purpose, a benchmark with 180 tasks is conducted, consisting of adapted HumanEval tasks and practical SAP scenarios. The results show significant performance differences between the models: more powerful LLMs achieve success rates of around 75% after several iterations and benefit greatly from compiler feedback, while smaller models perform significantly weaker. Overall, the study highlights the high potential of powerful LLMs for ABAP development processes, especially in iterative error correction.",

    "abstract": "In this work we analyze the problem of, given the probability distribution of a population, questioning an unknown individual that is representative of the distribution so that our uncertainty about certain characteristics is significantly reduced -but the uncertainty about others, deemed private or sensitive, is not. Thus, the goal of the problem is extracting information being relevant to a legitimate purpose while preserving the privacy of individuals, which is crucial to enable non-intrusive selection processes in several areas. For instance, it is essential in the design of non-discriminatory personnel selection, promotion, and layoff processes in companies and institutions; in the retrieval of customer information being relevant to the service provided by a company (and no more); in certifications not revealing sensitive industrial information being irrelevant for the certification itself; etc. Interactive questioning processes are constructed for this purpose, which requires generalizing the notion of decision trees to account the amount of desired and undesired information retrieved for each branch of the plan. Our findings about this problem are both theoretical and practical: on the one hand, we prove its NP-completeness by a reduction from the Set Cover problem; and on the other hand, given this intractability, we provide heuristic solutions to find reasonable solutions in affordable time. In particular, a greedy algorithm and two genetic algorithms are presented. Our experiments indicate that the best results are obtained using a genetic algorithm reinforced with a greedy strategy.",

    "abstract": "Fog and mobile edge computing (MEC) will play a key role in the upcoming fifth generation (5G) mobile networks to support decentralized applications, data analytics and management into the network itself by using a highly distributed compute model. Furthermore, increasing attention is paid to providing user-centric cybersecurity solutions, which particularly require collecting, processing and analyzing significantly large amount of data traffic and huge number of network connections in 5G networks. In this regard, this paper proposes a MEC-oriented solution in 5G mobile networks to detect network anomalies in real-time and in autonomic way. Our proposal uses deep learning techniques to analyze network flows and to detect network anomalies. Moreover, it uses policies in order to provide an efficient and dynamic management system of the computing resources used in the anomaly detection process. The paper presents relevant aspects of the deployment of the proposal and experimental results to show its performance.",

    "abstract": "Peer review is at the heart of modern science. As submission numbers rise and research communities grow, the decline in review quality is a popular narrative and a common concern. Yet, is it true? Review quality is difficult to measure, and the ongoing evolution of reviewing practices makes it hard to compare reviews across venues and time. To address this, we introduce a new framework for evidence-based comparative study of review quality and apply it to major AI and machine learning conferences: ICLR, NeurIPS and *ACL. We document the diversity of review formats and introduce a new approach to review standardization. We propose a multi-dimensional schema for quantifying review quality as utility to editors and authors, coupled with both LLM-based and lightweight measurements. We study the relationships between measurements of review quality, and its evolution over time. Contradicting the popular narrative, our cross-temporal analysis reveals no consistent decline in median review quality across venues and years. We propose alternative explanations, and outline recommendations to facilitate future empirical studies of review quality.",

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of research across machine learning, vision, and language has produced a volume of publications that is increasingly difficult to synthesize. Traditional bibliometric tools rely mainly on metadata and offer limited visibility into the semantic content of papers, making it hard to track how research themes evolve over time or how different areas influence one another. To obtain a clearer picture of recent developments, we compile a unified corpus of more than 100,000 papers from 22 major conferences between 2020 and 2025 and construct a multidimensional profiling pipeline to organize and analyze their textual content. By combining topic clustering, LLM-assisted parsing, and structured retrieval, we derive a comprehensive representation of research activity that supports the study of topic lifecycles, methodological transitions, dataset and model usage patterns, and institutional research directions. Our analysis highlights several notable shifts, including the growth of safety, multimodal reasoning, and agent-oriented studies, as well as the gradual stabilization of areas such as neural machine translation and graph-based methods. These findings provide an evidence-based view of how AI research is evolving and offer a resource for understanding broader trends and identifying emerging directions.

DeGAS evaluates programs under a Gaussian-mixture semantics and replaces measure-zero predicates and discrete branches with a vanishing smoothing, yielding closed-form expressions for posterior and path probabilities. We prove differentiability of these quantities with respect to program parameters, enabling end-to-end optimization via standard automatic differentiation, without Monte Carlo estimators.

    "abstract": "Next-generation networks explore the opportunistic assistance of airliner/high-altitude platforms (HAPs) in delivering high data rates for terrestrial networks to ensure consistent and reliable communication. When an airliner/HAP moves at very high speeds, its mobility has a substantial impact on ensuring seamless connectivity, stable signal strength, and reliable data transmission. Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has been shown to provide notable improvement in performance when handling Doppler effects during high-mobility situations. This paper presents an OTFS-based airplane-aided next-generation networking system. In the proposed system, the airliner/HAPs are equipped with a planar antenna array that applies null steering beamforming (NSB) at the transmitter for communication with terrestrial users. A comprehensive performance comparison between OTFS and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is performed under varying airliner altitude, velocity, array dimension, and Rician factor conditions. The simulation results show that OTFS consistently outperforms OFDM, achieving a lower bit error rate (BER) and more stable performance across different airliner altitudes, velocities, array dimensions, and propagation environments.",

    "title": "The Flexibility Trap: Why Arbitrary Order Limits Reasoning Potential in Diffusion Language Models",
    "abstract": "Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) break the rigid left-to-right constraint of traditional LLMs, enabling token generation in arbitrary orders. Intuitively, this flexibility implies a solution space that strictly supersets the fixed autoregressive trajectory, theoretically unlocking superior reasoning potential for general tasks like mathematics and coding. Consequently, numerous works have leveraged reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit the reasoning capability of dLLMs. In this paper, we reveal a counter-intuitive reality: arbitrary order generation, in its current form, narrows rather than expands the reasoning boundary of dLLMs. We find that dLLMs tend to exploit this order flexibility to bypass high-uncertainty tokens that are crucial for exploration, leading to a premature collapse of the solution space. This observation challenges the premise of existing RL approaches for dLLMs, where considerable complexities, such as handling combinatorial trajectories and intractable likelihoods, are often devoted to preserving this flexibility. We demonstrate that effective reasoning is better elicited by intentionally forgoing arbitrary order and applying standard Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) instead. Our approach, JustGRPO, is minimalist yet surprisingly effective (e.g., 89.1% accuracy on GSM8K) while fully retaining the parallel decoding ability of dLLMs. Project page: https://nzl-thu.github.io/the-flexibility-trap",

    "abstract": "Learning long-horizon embodied behaviors from synthetic data remains challenging because generated scenes are often physically implausible, language-driven programs frequently \"succeed\" without satisfying task semantics, and high-level instructions require grounding into executable action sequences. To address these limitations, we introduce V-CAGE, a closed-loop framework for generating robust, semantically aligned manipulation datasets at scale. First, we propose a context-aware instantiation mechanism that enforces geometric consistency during scene synthesis. By dynamically maintaining a map of prohibited spatial areas as objects are placed, our system prevents interpenetration and ensures reachable, conflict-free configurations in cluttered environments. Second, to bridge the gap between abstract intent and low-level control, we employ a hierarchical instruction decomposition module. This decomposes high-level goals (e.g., \"get ready for work\") into compositional action primitives, facilitating coherent long-horizon planning. Crucially, we enforce semantic correctness through a VLM-based verification loop. Acting as a visual critic, the VLM performs rigorous rejection sampling after each subtask, filtering out \"silent failures\" where code executes but fails to achieve the visual goal. Experiments demonstrate that V-CAGE yields datasets with superior physical and semantic fidelity, significantly boosting the success rate and generalization of downstream policies compared to non-verified baselines.",

Through collaborations with a large Canadian CW agency, we examined how LocalLLM and BERTopic models can track CW case progress. We demonstrate how the tools can potentially assist workers in opportunistically addressing gaps in their work by signaling case progress/deviations. And yet, we also show how they fail to detect case trajectories that require discretionary judgments grounded in social work training, areas where practitioners would actually want support to pre-emptively address substantive case concerns.

    "title": "Automated Rubrics for Reliable Evaluation of Medical Dialogue Systems",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for clinical decision support, where hallucinations and unsafe suggestions may pose direct risks to patient safety. These risks are particularly challenging as they often manifest as subtle clinical errors that evade detection by generic metrics, while expert-authored fine-grained rubrics remain costly to construct and difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed to automate the generation of instance-specific evaluation rubrics. Our approach grounds evaluation in authoritative medical evidence by decomposing retrieved content into atomic facts and synthesizing them with user interaction constraints to form verifiable, fine-grained evaluation criteria. Evaluated on HealthBench, our framework achieves a Clinical Intent Alignment (CIA) score of 60.12%, a statistically significant improvement over the GPT-4o baseline (55.16%). In discriminative tests, our rubrics yield a mean score delta ($μ_Δ = 8.658$) and an AUROC of 0.977, nearly doubling the quality separation achieved by GPT-4o baseline (4.972). Beyond evaluation, our rubrics effectively guide response refinement, improving quality by 9.2% (from 59.0% to 68.2%). This provides a scalable and transparent foundation for both evaluating and improving medical LLMs. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Automated-Rubric-Generation-AF3C/.",

    "abstract": "Large language models have achieved near-expert performance in structured reasoning domains like mathematics and programming, yet their ability to perform compositional multi-hop reasoning in specialized scientific fields remains limited. We propose a bottom-up learning paradigm in which models are grounded in axiomatic domain facts and compose them to solve complex, unseen tasks. To this end, we present a post-training pipeline, based on a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), in which knowledge graphs act as implicit reward models. By deriving novel reward signals from knowledge graph paths, we provide verifiable, scalable, and grounded supervision that encourages models to compose intermediate axioms rather than optimize only final answers during RL. We validate this approach in the medical domain, training a 14B model on short-hop reasoning paths (1-3 hops) and evaluating its zero-shot generalization to complex multi-hop queries (4-5 hops). Our experiments show that path-derived rewards act as a \"compositional bridge\", enabling our model to significantly outperform much larger models and frontier systems like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro, on the most difficult reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to adversarial perturbations against option-shuffling stress tests. This work suggests that grounding the reasoning process in structured knowledge is a scalable and efficient path toward intelligent reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Transformers trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) with outcome-based supervision can spontaneously develop the ability to generate intermediate reasoning steps (Chain-of-Thought). Yet the mechanism by which sparse rewards drive gradient descent to discover such systematic reasoning remains poorly understood. We address this by analyzing the gradient flow dynamics of single-layer Transformers on a synthetic graph traversal task that cannot be solved without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) but admits a simple iterative solution. We prove that despite training solely on final-answer correctness, gradient flow drives the model to converge to a structured, interpretable algorithm that iteratively traverses the graph vertex-by-vertex. We characterize the distributional properties required for this emergence, identifying the critical role of \"simple examples\": instances requiring fewer reasoning steps. When the training distribution places sufficient mass on these simpler instances, the model learns a generalizable traversal strategy that extrapolates to longer chains; when this mass vanishes, gradient-based learning becomes infeasible. We corroborate our theoretical results through experiments on synthetic data and with real-world language models on mathematical reasoning tasks, validating that our theoretical findings carry over to practical settings.",

    "abstract": "Culverts and sewer pipes are critical components of drainage systems, and their failure can lead to serious risks to public safety and the environment. In this thesis, we explore methods to improve automated defect segmentation in culverts and sewer pipes. Collecting and annotating data in this field is cumbersome and requires domain knowledge. Having a large dataset for structural defect detection is therefore not feasible. Our proposed methods are tested under conditions with limited annotated data to demonstrate applicability to real-world scenarios. Overall, this thesis proposes three methods to significantly enhance defect segmentation and handle data scarcity. This can be addressed either by enhancing the training data or by adjusting a models architecture.   First, we evaluate preprocessing strategies, including traditional data augmentation and dynamic label injection. These techniques significantly improve segmentation performance, increasing both Intersection over Union (IoU) and F1 score. Second, we introduce FORTRESS, a novel architecture that combines depthwise separable convolutions, adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), and multi-scale attention mechanisms. FORTRESS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the culvert sewer pipe defect dataset, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters, as well as its computational cost. Finally, we investigate few-shot semantic segmentation and its applicability to defect detection. Few-shot learning aims to train models with only limited data available. By employing a bidirectional prototypical network with attention mechanisms, the model achieves richer feature representations and achieves satisfactory results across evaluation metrics.",

In this paper, we propose the SAGA approach to detect and locate vulnerabilities in Python source code in a versatile way. SAGA includes a source code parser able to extract control- and data-flow information and to represent it as a symbolic control-flow graph, as well as a domain-specific language defining static aspects of the source code and their evolution during graph traversals. We have leveraged this language to define a library of static aspects for integrity, confidentiality, and other security-related properties.   We have evaluated SAGA on a dataset of 108 vulnerabilities, obtaining 100% sensitivity and 99.15% specificity, with only one false positive, while outperforming four common security analysis tools.

Part of the network infrastructure, FPGAs are tailored to guarantee low-latency and high-throughput packet processing. However, slowness of the hardware design process impairs FPGA ability to be part of an agile infrastructure under constant evolution, from incident response to long-term transformation. Deploying and maintaining network functionalities across a wide variety of FPGAs raises the need to fine-tune hardware designs for several FPGA targets. To address this issue, we introduce PAF, an open-source architectural parameterization framework based on a pipeline-oriented design methodology. PAF (Pipeline Automation Framework) implementation is based on Chisel, a Scala-embedded Hardware Construction Language (HCL), that we leverage to interface with circuit elaboration. Applied to industrial network packet classification systems, PAF demonstrates efficient parameterization abilities, enabling to reuse and optimize the same pipelined design on several FPGAs. In addition, PAF focuses the pipeline description on the architectural intent, incidentally reducing the number of lines of code to express complex functionalities. Finally, PAF confirms that automation does not imply any loss of tight control on the architecture by achieving on par performance and resource usage with equivalent exhaustively described implementations.",

A job is covered if the machine is configured to its color during its whole processing interval. The goal of the machine is to maximize the sum of weights of all covered jobs, and the goal of each player is to place its jobs such that the sum of weights of covered jobs from its color is maximized. The study of this game is motivated by several applications like antenna scheduling for wireless networks.   We first show that given a strategy profile of the players, the machine scheduling problem can be solved in polynomial time. We then study the game from the players' point of view. We analyze the existence of Nash equilibria, its computation, and inefficiency. We distinguish between instances of the classical interval scheduling problem, in which every player controls a single job, and instances in which color sets may include multiple jobs.",

    "abstract": "Gaze-based interaction enables intuitive, hands-free control in immersive environments, but remains susceptible to unintended inputs. We present a real-time error prevention system (EPS) that uses a temporal convolutional network autoencoder (TCNAE) to detect anomalies in gaze dynamics during selection tasks. In a visual search task in VR, 41 participants used three gaze-based methods - dwell time, gaze and head direction alignment, and nod - with and without EPS. The system reduced erroneous selections by up to 95% for dwell time and gaze and head, and was positively received by most users. Performance varied for nodding and between individuals, suggesting the need for adaptive systems. Objective metrics and subjective evaluations show that anomaly-based error prevention can improve gaze interfaces without disrupting interaction. These findings demonstrate the potential of anomaly-based error prevention for gaze interfaces and suggest applications in VR, AR, and assistive technologies.",

    "title": "CLEANER: Self-Purified Trajectories Boost Agentic Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Agentic Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) to utilize tools like Python interpreters for complex problem-solving. However, for parameter-constrained models (e.g., 4B--7B), the exploration phase is often plagued by frequent execution failures, creating noisy trajectories that hinder policy optimization. Under standard outcome-based reward settings, this noise leads to a critical credit assignment issue, where erroneous actions are inadvertently reinforced alongside successful outcomes. Existing mitigations face a dilemma: dense rewards often trigger reward hacking, while supersampling incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANER. Distinct from external filtering methods, CLEANER exploits the model's intrinsic self-correction capabilities to eliminate error-contaminated context directly during data collection. At its core, the Similarity-Aware Adaptive Rollback (SAAR) mechanism autonomously constructs clean, purified trajectories by retrospectively replacing failures with successful self-corrections. Based on semantic similarity, SAAR adaptively regulates replacement granularity from shallow execution repairs to deep reasoning substitutions. By training on these self-purified paths, the model internalizes correct reasoning patterns rather than error-recovery loops. Empirical results on AIME24/25, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench show average accuracy gains of 6%, 3%, and 5% over baselines. Notably, CLEANER matches state-of-the-art performance using only one-third of the training steps, highlighting trajectory purification as a scalable solution for efficient agentic RL.

    "abstract": "Metadata of libraries on the Python Package Index (PyPI)-including links to source code repositories and donation platforms-plays a critical role in supporting the transparency, trust, and sustainability of open-source libraries. Yet, many packages lack such metadata, and little is known about the underlying reasons. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study combining two targeted surveys sent to 50,000 PyPI authors and maintainers. We analyze more than 1,400 responses using large language model (LLM)-based topic modeling to uncover key motivations and barriers related to linking repositories and donation platforms. While repository URLs are often linked to foster collaboration, increase transparency, and enable issue tracking, some maintainers omit them due to oversight, laziness, or the perceived irrelevance to their project. Donation platform links are reported to support open source work or receive financial contributions, but are hindered by skepticism, technical friction, and organizational constraints. Cross-cutting challenges-such as outdated links, lack of awareness, and unclear guidance-affect both types of metadata. We further assess the robustness of our topic modeling pipeline across 30 runs (84% lexical and 89% semantic similarity) and validate topic quality with 23 expert raters (Randolph's kappa = 0.55). The study contributes empirical insights into PyPI's metadata practices and provides recommendations for improving them, while also demonstrating the effectiveness of our topic modeling approach for analyzing short-text survey responses.",

Through micro-benchmarks and case studies on OCR and fact-checking, we quantify the \"efficiency tax\"-demonstrating a ~6.5x latency penalty-and the risks of algorithmic sycophancy. To counter this, we introduce Tool Selection Engineering and the Deterministic-Probabilistic Decision Matrix, a framework to help developers determine when to use Generative AI and, crucially, when to avoid it. We argue for a curriculum shift, emphasizing that true digital literacy relies not only in knowing how to use Generative AI, but also on knowing when not to use it.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models have demonstrated comparable performance to that of radiology trainees on multiple-choice board-style exams. However, to develop clinically useful multimodal LLM tools, high-quality benchmarks curated by domain experts are essential. To curate released and holdout datasets of 100 chest radiographic studies each and propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted expert labeling procedure to allow radiologists to label studies more efficiently. A total of 13,735 deidentified chest radiographs and their corresponding reports from the MIDRC were used. GPT-4o extracted abnormal findings from the reports, which were then mapped to 12 benchmark labels with a locally hosted LLM (Phi-4-Reasoning). From these studies, 1,000 were sampled on the basis of the AI-suggested benchmark labels for expert review; the sampling algorithm ensured that the selected studies were clinically relevant and captured a range of difficulty levels. Seventeen chest radiologists participated, and they marked \"Agree all\", \"Agree mostly\" or \"Disagree\" to indicate their assessment of the correctness of the LLM suggested labels. Each chest radiograph was evaluated by three experts. Of these, at least two radiologists selected \"Agree All\" for 381 radiographs. From this set, 200 were selected, prioritizing those with less common or multiple finding labels, and divided into 100 released radiographs and 100 reserved as the holdout dataset. The holdout dataset is used exclusively by RSNA to independently evaluate different models. A benchmark of 200 chest radiographic studies with 12 benchmark labels was created and made publicly available https://imaging.rsna.org, with each chest radiograph verified by three radiologists. In addition, an AI-assisted labeling procedure was developed to help radiologists label at scale, minimize unnecessary omissions, and support a semicollaborative environment.",

    "abstract": "Federated Neural Architecture Search (FedNAS) aims to automate model design for privacy-preserving Federated Learning (FL) but currently faces two critical bottlenecks: unguided supernet training that yields suboptimal models, and costly multi-hour pipelines for post-training subnet discovery. We introduce DeepFedNAS, a novel, two-phase framework underpinned by a principled, multi-objective fitness function that synthesizes mathematical network design with architectural heuristics. Enabled by a re-engineered supernet, DeepFedNAS introduces Federated Pareto Optimal Supernet Training, which leverages a pre-computed Pareto-optimal cache of high-fitness architectures as an intelligent curriculum to optimize shared supernet weights. Subsequently, its Predictor-Free Search Method eliminates the need for costly accuracy surrogates by utilizing this fitness function as a direct, zero-cost proxy for accuracy, enabling on-demand subnet discovery in mere seconds. DeepFedNAS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (e.g., up to 1.21% absolute improvement on CIFAR-100), superior parameter and communication efficiency, and a substantial ~61x speedup in total post-training search pipeline time. By reducing the pipeline from over 20 hours to approximately 20 minutes (including initial cache generation) and enabling 20-second individual subnet searches, DeepFedNAS makes hardware-aware FL deployments instantaneous and practical.

    "abstract": "Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have emerged as a frontier in graph learning, which are expected to deliver transferable representations across diverse tasks. However, GFMs remain constrained by in-memory bottlenecks: they attempt to encode knowledge into model parameters, which limits semantic capacity, introduces heavy lossy compression with conflicts, and entangles graph representation with the knowledge in ways that hinder efficient adaptation, undermining scalability and interpretability. In this work,we propose RAG-GFM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation aided Graph Foundation Model that offloads knowledge from parameters and complements parameterized learning. To externalize graph knowledge, we build a dual-modal unified retrieval module, where a semantic store from prefix-structured text and a structural store from centrality-based motif. To preserve heterogeneous information, we design a dual-view alignment objective that contrasts both modalities to capture both content and relational patterns. To enable efficient downstream adaptation, we perform in-context augmentation to enrich supporting instances with retrieved texts and motifs as contextual evidence. Extensive experiments on five benchmark graph datasets demonstrate that RAG-GFM consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines in both cross-domain node and graph classification, achieving superior effectiveness and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Promptable segmentation models such as SAM have established a powerful paradigm, enabling strong generalization to unseen objects and domains with minimal user input, including points, bounding boxes, and text prompts. Among these, bounding boxes stand out as particularly effective, often outperforming points while significantly reducing annotation costs. However, current training and evaluation protocols typically rely on synthetic prompts generated through simple heuristics, offering limited insight into real-world robustness. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of promptable segmentation models to natural variations in bounding box prompts. First, we conduct a controlled user study and collect thousands of real bounding box annotations. Our analysis reveals substantial variability in segmentation quality across users for the same model and instance, indicating that SAM-like models are highly sensitive to natural prompt noise. Then, since exhaustive testing of all possible user inputs is computationally prohibitive, we reformulate robustness evaluation as a white-box optimization problem over the bounding box prompt space. We introduce BREPS, a method for generating adversarial bounding boxes that minimize or maximize segmentation error while adhering to naturalness constraints. Finally, we benchmark state-of-the-art models across 10 datasets, spanning everyday scenes to medical imaging. Code - https://github.com/emb-ai/BREPS.",

This imbalance can reduce recommendation quality and lead to unfair item exposure. Although existing mitigation methods address this issue to some extent, they often lack transparency in how they operate. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc approach, PopSteer, that leverages a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to both interpret and mitigate popularity bias in recommendation models. The SAE is trained to replicate a trained model's behavior while enabling neuron-level interpretability. By introducing synthetic users with strong preferences for either popular or unpopular items, we identify neurons encoding popularity signals through their activation patterns. We then steer recommendations by adjusting the activations of the most biased neurons. Experiments on three public datasets with a sequential recommendation model demonstrate that PopSteer significantly enhances fairness with minimal impact on accuracy, while providing interpretable insights and fine-grained control over the fairness-accuracy trade-off.",

    "abstract": "LLMs have advanced tool-using agents for real-world applications, yet they often lead to unexpected behaviors or results. Beyond obvious failures, the subtle issue of \"intent deviation\" severely hinders reliable evaluation and performance improvement. Existing post-training methods generally leverage either real system samples or virtual data simulated by LLMs. However, the former is costly due to reliance on hand-crafted user requests, while the latter suffers from distribution shift from the real tools in the wild. Additionally, both methods lack negative samples tailored to intent deviation scenarios, hindering effective guidance on preference learning. We introduce RISE, a \"Real-to-Virtual\" method designed to mitigate intent deviation. Anchoring on verified tool primitives, RISE synthesizes virtual trajectories and generates diverse negative samples through mutation on critical parameters. With synthetic data, RISE fine-tunes backbone LLMs via the two-stage training for intent alignment. Evaluation results demonstrate that data synthesized by RISE achieve promising results in eight metrics covering user requires, execution trajectories and agent responses. Integrating with training, RISE achieves an average 35.28% improvement in Acctask (task completion) and 23.27% in Accintent (intent alignment), outperforming SOTA baselines by 1.20--42.09% and 1.17--54.93% respectively.",

    "abstract": "Whisper has become the de-facto encoder for extracting general-purpose audio features in large audio-language models, where a 30-second clip is typically represented by 1500 frame features projected into an LLM. In contrast, audio-text embedding models like CLAP-based models have largely relied on alternative audio encoders (e.g., HTS-AT, PaSST), and have not leveraged Whisper effectively. We present WavLink, a compact audio-text embedding model that augments Whisper encoder with a learnable global token, trained jointly with a text encoder. Through a systematic study of design choices, including pretrained text encoders, loss functions, training modes, and data mixtures, we identify configurations that yield state-of-the-art retrieval performance. Our two-stage training recipe across three model sizes, combined with Matryoshka-style supervision, improves scalability, enabling 8x smaller embeddings with minimal performance drop. WavLink also demonstrates competitive performance on AIR-Bench with MCQs and zero-shot classification.",

    "title": "Training-Free and Interpretable Hateful Video Detection via Multi-stage Adversarial Reasoning",
    "abstract": "Hateful videos pose serious risks by amplifying discrimination, inciting violence, and undermining online safety. Existing training-based hateful video detection methods are constrained by limited training data and lack of interpretability, while directly prompting large vision-language models often struggle to deliver reliable hate detection. To address these challenges, this paper introduces MARS, a training-free Multi-stage Adversarial ReaSoning framework that enables reliable and interpretable hateful content detection. MARS begins with the objective description of video content, establishing a neutral foundation for subsequent analysis. Building on this, it develops evidence-based reasoning that supports potential hateful interpretations, while in parallel incorporating counter-evidence reasoning to capture plausible non-hateful perspectives. Finally, these perspectives are synthesized into a conclusive and explainable decision. Extensive evaluation on two real-world datasets shows that MARS achieves up to 10% improvement under certain backbones and settings compared to other training-free approaches and outperforms state-of-the-art training-based methods on one dataset. In addition, MARS produces human-understandable justifications, thereby supporting compliance oversight and enhancing the transparency of content moderation workflows.

    "abstract": "Generative Agent-Based Modeling (GABM) leverages Large Language Models to create autonomous agents that simulate human behavior in social media environments, demonstrating potential for modeling information propagation, influence processes, and network phenomena. While existing frameworks characterize agents through demographic attributes, personality traits, and interests, they lack mechanisms to encode behavioral dispositions toward platform actions, causing agents to exhibit homogeneous engagement patterns rather than the differentiated participation styles observed on real platforms. In this paper, we investigate the role of behavioral traits as an explicit characterization layer to regulate agents' propensities across posting, re-sharing, commenting, reacting, and inactivity. Through large-scale simulations involving 980 agents and validation against real-world social media data, we demonstrate that behavioral traits are essential to sustain heterogeneous, profile-consistent participation patterns and enable realistic content propagation dynamics through the interplay of amplification- and interaction-oriented profiles. Our findings establish that modeling how agents act-not only who they are-is necessary for advancing GABM as a tool for studying social media phenomena.",

However, conventional imaging approaches, whether based on physical models or data-driven learning, face challenges such as accurate multipath separation and representative dataset acquisition. To address these issues, this study explores the use of implicit neural representation (INR), a paradigm that has achieved notable advancements in computer vision, for wireless imaging in reconfigurable intelligent surface-aided ISAC systems. The neural network of INR is specifically designed with positional encoding and sine activation functions. Leveraging physics-informed loss functions, INR is optimized through deep learning to represent continuous target shapes and scattering profiles, enabling resolution-agnostic imaging with strong generalization capability. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed INR-based method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art techniques and further reveals the focal length characteristics of the imaging system.",

    "abstract": "We expose a critical limitation in current approaches to machine unlearning in language models: despite the apparent success of unlearning algorithms, information about the forgotten data remains linearly decodable from internal representations. To systematically assess this discrepancy, we introduce an interpretable, information-theoretic framework for auditing unlearning using Partial Information Decomposition (PID). By comparing model representations before and after unlearning, we decompose the mutual information with the forgotten data into distinct components, formalizing the notions of unlearned and residual knowledge. Our analysis reveals that redundant information, shared across both models, constitutes residual knowledge that persists post-unlearning and correlates with susceptibility to known adversarial reconstruction attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose a representation-based risk score that can guide abstention on sensitive inputs at inference time, providing a practical mechanism to mitigate privacy leakage. Our work introduces a principled, representation-level audit for unlearning, offering theoretical insight and actionable tools for safer deployment of language models.",

    "abstract": "Garment simulation is fundamental to various applications in computer vision and graphics, from virtual try-on to digital human modelling. However, conventional physics-based methods remain computationally expensive, hindering their application in time-sensitive scenarios. While graph neural networks (GNNs) offer promising acceleration, existing approaches exhibit poor cross-resolution generalisation, demonstrating significant performance degradation on higher-resolution meshes beyond the training distribution. This stems from two key factors: (1) existing GNNs employ fixed message-passing depth that fails to adapt information aggregation to mesh density variation, and (2) vertex-wise displacement magnitudes are inherently resolution-dependent in garment simulation. To address these issues, we introduce Propagation-before-Update Graph Network (Pb4U-GNet), a resolution-adaptive framework that decouples message propagation from feature updates. Pb4U-GNet incorporates two key mechanisms: (1) dynamic propagation depth control, adjusting message-passing iterations based on mesh resolution, and (2) geometry-aware update scaling, which scales predictions according to local mesh characteristics. Extensive experiments show that even trained solely on low-resolution meshes, Pb4U-GNet exhibits strong generalisability across diverse mesh resolutions, addressing a fundamental challenge in neural garment simulation.",

    "abstract": "The interoperability of data and intelligence across allied partners and their respective end-user groups is considered a foundational enabler to the collective defense capability--both conventional and hybrid--of NATO countries. Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) and related hybrid activities are conducted across various societal dimensions and infospheres, posing an ever greater challenge to the characterization of threats, sustaining situational awareness, and response coordination. Recent advances in AI have further led to the decreasing cost of AI-augmented trolling and interference activities, such as through the generation and amplification of manipulative content. Despite the introduction of the DISARM framework as a standardized metadata and analytical framework for FIMI, operationalizing it at the scale of social media remains a challenge. We propose a framework-agnostic agent-based operationalization of DISARM to investigate FIMI on social media. We develop a multi-agent pipeline in which specialized agentic AI components collaboratively (1) detect candidate manipulative behaviors, and (2) map these behaviors onto standard DISARM taxonomies in a transparent manner. We evaluated the approach on two real-world datasets annotated by domain practitioners. We demonstrate that our approach is effective in scaling the predominantly manual and heavily interpretive work of FIMI analysis, providing a direct contribution to enhancing the situational awareness and data interoperability in the context of operating in media and information-rich settings.",

To address this, we developed an interpretable deep learning model that predicts cell survival after proton and carbon ion irradiation, leveraging sequential attention to highlight relevant features and provide insight into the contribution of different energy deposition scales. Trained and tested on the PIDE dataset, our model incorporates, beside LET, nanodosimetric and microdosimetric quantities simulated with MC-Startrack and Open-TOPAS, enabling multi-scale characterization. While achieving high predictive accuracy, our approach also emphasizes transparency in decision-making. We demonstrate high accuracy in predicting RBE for in vitro experiments.

    "abstract": "The provision of services by more than one operator over a common network infrastructure, as enabled by 5G network slicing, is analyzed. Two business models to be implemented by a network operator, who owns the network, and a virtual operator, who does not, are proposed. In one business model, named \\emph{strategic}, the network operator provides service to its user base and the virtual operator provides service to its user base and pays a per-subscriber fee to the network operator. In the other business model, named \\emph{monopolistic}, the network operator provides service to both user bases. The two proposals are analyzed by means of a model that captures both system and economic features. As regards the systems features, the slicing of the network is modeled by means of a Discriminatory Processor Sharing queue. As regards the economic features, the incentives are modeled by means of the user utilities and the operators' revenues; and game theory is used to model the strategic interaction between the users' subscription decision and the operators' pricing decision. In both business models, it is shown that the network operator can be provided with the appropriate economic incentives so that it acquiesces in serving the virtual operator's user base (monopolistic model) and in allowing the virtual operator to provide service over the network operator's infrastructure (strategic model). From the point of view of the users, the strategic model results in a higher subscription rate than the monopolistic model.",

Here, we present the Field-Space Autoencoder, a scalable climate emulation framework based on a spherical compression model that overcomes these challenges. By utilizing Field-Space Attention, the model efficiently operates on native climate model output and therefore avoids geometric distortions caused by forcing spherical data onto Euclidean grids. This approach preserves physical structures significantly better than convolutional baselines. By producing a structured compressed field, it serves as a good baseline for downstream generative emulation. In addition, the model can perform zero-shot super-resolution that maps low-resolution large ensembles and scarce high-resolution data into a shared representation. We train a generative diffusion model on these compressed fields. The model can simultaneously learn internal variability from abundant low-resolution data and fine-scale physics from sparse high-resolution data. Our work bridges the gap between the high volume of low-resolution ensemble statistics and the scarcity of high-resolution physical detail.",

    "abstract": "Everyday communication is dynamic and multisensory, often involving shifting attention, overlapping speech and visual cues. Yet, most neural attention tracking studies are still limited to highly controlled lab settings, using clean, often audio-only stimuli and requiring sustained attention to a single talker. This work addresses that gap by introducing a novel dataset from 24 normal-hearing participants. We used a mobile electroencephalography (EEG) system (44 scalp electrodes and 20 cEEGrid electrodes) in an audiovisual (AV) paradigm with three conditions: sustained attention to a single talker in a two-talker environment, attention switching between two talkers, and unscripted two-talker conversations with a competing single talker. Analysis included temporal response functions (TRFs) modeling, optimal lag analysis, selective attention classification with decision windows ranging from 1.1s to 35s, and comparisons of TRFs for attention to AV conversations versus side audio-only talkers. Key findings show significant differences in the attention-related P2-peak between attended and ignored speech across conditions for scalp EEG. No significant change in performance between switching and sustained attention suggests robustness for attention switches. Optimal lag analysis revealed narrower peak for conversation compared to single-talker AV stimuli, reflecting the additional complexity of multi-talker processing. Classification of selective attention was consistently above chance (55-70% accuracy) for scalp EEG, while cEEGrid data yielded lower correlations, highlighting the need for further methodological improvements. These results demonstrate that mobile EEG can reliably track selective attention in dynamic, multisensory listening scenarios and provide guidance for designing future AV paradigms and real-world attention tracking applications.",

However, their scale incurs substantial computational costs, making full fine-tuning impractical.

Recent studies show QLoRA-optimized Large Code Models (LCMs) perform strongly across diverse tasks, yet it remains unclear whether this effectiveness persists when a single model is QLoRA fine-tuned for multiple code-related tasks. The interaction between Multi-task fine-tuning and QLoRA optimization, and how transfer learning affects correctness and quality of generated artifacts, remains largely unexplored. We investigate Multi-task QLoRA fine-tuning across three representative tasks: code generation, translation, and summarization. We evaluate functional correctness through execution-based and similarity-based metrics, complemented by comprehensive code quality analysis--an aspect largely overlooked in prior work. Our findings show that Multi-task QLoRA effectively leverages transfer learning, achieving competitive or superior performance relative to both Single-task QLoRA and Multi-task full fine-tuning. Larger models demonstrate more consistent balance between correctness and quality, whereas smaller models preserve functionality but exhibit a higher incidence of quality-related issues.",

Distinguishing between local and global semantic entropy reveals a systematic temporal dissociation: local semantic exploration peaks in the morning, reflecting broader exploration of semantic space, whereas global semantic diversity peaks later in the day as submissions accumulate around already established topics, consistent with \"rich-get-richer\" dynamics. These patterns are not explained by sentiment or affective valence, indicating that semantic exploration captures a cognitive dimension distinct from mood.

    "title": "Memory Retention Is Not Enough to Master Memory Tasks in Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Effective decision-making in the real world depends on memory that is both stable and adaptive: environments change over time, and agents must retain relevant information over long horizons while also updating or overwriting outdated content when circumstances shift. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) benchmarks and memory-augmented agents focus primarily on retention, leaving the equally critical ability of memory rewriting largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a benchmark that explicitly tests continual memory updating under partial observability, i.e. the natural setting where an agent must rely on memory rather than current observations, and use it to compare recurrent, transformer-based, and structured memory architectures. Our experiments reveal that classic recurrent models, despite their simplicity, demonstrate greater flexibility and robustness in memory rewriting tasks than modern structured memories, which succeed only under narrow conditions, and transformer-based agents, which often fail beyond trivial retention cases. These findings expose a fundamental limitation of current approaches and emphasize the necessity of memory mechanisms that balance stable retention with adaptive updating. Our work highlights this overlooked challenge, introduces benchmarks to evaluate it, and offers insights for designing future RL agents with explicit and trainable forgetting mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Parser-based log compression, which separates static templates from dynamic variables, is a promising approach to exploit the unique structure of log data. However, its performance on complex production logs is often unsatisfactory. This performance gap coincides with a known degradation in the accuracy of its core log parsing component on such data, motivating our investigation into a foundational yet unverified question: does higher parsing accuracy necessarily lead to better compression ratio?   To answer this, we conduct the first empirical study quantifying this relationship and find that a higher parsing accuracy does not guarantee a better compression ratio. Instead, our findings reveal that compression ratio is dictated by achieving effective pattern-based grouping and encoding, i.e., the partitioning of tokens into low entropy, highly compressible groups.   Guided by this insight, we design DeLog, a novel log compressor that implements a Pattern Signature Synthesis mechanism to achieve efficient pattern-based grouping. On 16 public and 10 production datasets, DeLog achieves state-of-the-art compression ratio and speed.",

    "title": "Bangla Music Genre Classification Using Bidirectional LSTMS",
    "abstract": "Bangla music is enrich in its own music cultures. Now a days music genre classification is very significant because of the exponential increase in available music, both in digital and physical formats. It is necessary to index them accordingly to facilitate improved retrieval. Automatically classifying Bangla music by genre is essential for efficiently locating specific pieces within a vast and diverse music library. Prevailing methods for genre classification predominantly employ conventional machine learning or deep learning approaches. This work introduces a novel music dataset comprising ten distinct genres of Bangla music. For the task of audio classification, we utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. Specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is implemented to train the model and perform the classification. Feature extraction represents a foundational stage in audio data processing. This study utilizes Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) to transform raw audio waveforms into a compact and representative set of features. The proposed framework facilitates music genre classification by leveraging these extracted features. Experimental results demonstrate a classification accuracy of 78%, indicating the system's strong potential to enhance and streamline the organization of Bangla music genres.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are neural networks that aim to process graph data, capturing the relationships and interactions between nodes using the message-passing mechanism. GNN quantization has emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and accelerating inference in resource-constrained environments. Compared to quantization in LLMs, quantizing graph features is more emphasized in GNNs. Inspired by the above, we propose to leverage prompt learning, which manipulates the input data, to improve the performance of quantization-aware training (QAT) for GNNs. To mitigate the issue that prompting the node features alone can only make part of the quantized aggregation result optimal, we introduce Low-Rank Aggregation Prompting (LoRAP), which injects lightweight, input-dependent prompts into each aggregated feature to optimize the results of quantized aggregations. Extensive evaluations on 4 leading QAT frameworks over 9 graph datasets demonstrate that LoRAP consistently enhances the performance of low-bit quantized GNNs while introducing a minimal computational overhead.",

    "abstract": "Structural approaches to myth and narrative are compelling in close reading but hard to compare across traditions, media, and scale. We propose a formal framework that renders Lévi-Straussian transformation as mathematics while remaining readable as narrative analysis. Variants, superhero continuities, and franchise arcs are modeled as typed rewrite programs on a coupled two-register state $(X,Y)$, abstracting an everyday/social channel and a symbolic/legitimation channel. The canonical formula becomes coherence data: a natural transformation $η:U\\Rightarrow V$ between update endofunctors, where $U$ updates each register in place and $V$ performs a swap+inversion. Context is internalized by operator choice, turning naturality into a corpus-facing type check: failures diagnose mis-specified oppositions or illegal transport; successes witness coherent structural models. Order effects are summarized by a five-value invariant (Key). We apply the method to 80 narratives (20 folktales, 20 religious myths, 20 superheroes, 20 franchises), each encoded as $(a,b,x,y)$ with a Key. 59/80 (74\\%) explicitly name a normative constraint in $y$ (law, taboo, contract, prophecy), supporting the two-register abstraction. The result is a testable bridge between structural anthropology and cultural analytics: stories remain interpretable yet become transportable objects for computation, comparison, and falsifiable constraints on transformation.",

In this work, we provide a formal explanation for this phenomenon grounded in operator theory and constrained optimization. We model each agent as enforcing a distinct family of validity constraints on a shared solution state, and show that a MAS implements a factorized composition of constraint-enforcement operators. Under mild conditions, these dynamics converge to invariant solution sets defined by the intersection of agent constraint sets. Such invariant structures are generally not dynamically accessible to a single agent applying all constraints simultaneously, even when expressive capacity and information are identical. We extend this result from exact constraint enforcement to soft constraints via proximal operators, and apply the formalism to contemporary text-based dialog systems.",

The main goal of the present paper is to completely settle the longstanding open problem of computing the fixed-point proportion of geometric iterated Galois groups of polynomials. Indeed, we confirm the well-known conjecture that Chebyshev polynomials are the only complex polynomials whose geometric iterated Galois groups have positive fixed-point proportion. Our proof relies on methods from group theory, ergodic theory, martingale theory and complex dynamics. This result has direct applications to the proportion of periodic points of polynomials over finite fields.   The general framework developed in this paper applies more generally to rational functions over arbitrary fields and generalizes, via a unified approach, previous partial results, which have all been proved with very different methods.",

To formalize this approach, we introduce the concept of graph-admissible Lie algebras and analyze properties of valid graphs given the antisymmetry property of the Lie bracket as well as the Jacobi identity. Based on these foundations, we develop graph-theoretic criteria for solvability, nilpotency, presence of ideals, simplicity, semisimplicity, and reductiveness of an algebra. Practical algorithms are provided for constructing such graphs and those associated with the lower central series and derived series via an iterative pruning procedure. This visual framework allows for an intuitive understanding of Lie algebraic structures that goes beyond purely visual advantages, since it enables a simpler and swifter grasping of the algebras of interest beyond computational-heavy approaches. Examples, which include the Schrödinger and Lorentz algebra, illustrate the applicability of these tools to physically relevant cases. We further explore applications in physics, where the method facilitates computation of similtude relations essential for determining quantum mechanical time evolution via the Lie algebraic factorization method. Extensions to graded Lie algebras and related conjectures are discussed. Our approach bridges algebraic and combinatorial perspectives, offering both theoretical insights and computational tools into this area of mathematical physics.",

The numerical scheme is readily adapted for resolving ill-posed problems. Central to our approach is high-degree piecewise-polynomial approximation to the exact solution. We illustrate the accuracy and stability of our numerical solutions in the presence of noise through illustrative examples.

We obtain along the way a generalisation of the Stone-von Neumann theorem to the $\\ell$-modular setting, together with the Weil representation with coefficients in $R$ on the $R$-metaplectic group. Surprisingly enough, the latter $R$-metaplectic group happens to be split over the symplectic group if $\\ell = 2$. The theory also makes sense when $F$ is a finite field of odd characteristic. We also establish the irreducibility of the theta lift in the cuspidal case as long as $\\ell$ does not divide the pro-orders of the groups at stake and we provide a compatibility to congruences in this setting via an integral version of the theta lift.",

This yields closed-form candidates, an exact selection rule, and a necessary and sufficient existence test. Building on these characterizations, we develop practical algorithms, including an $O(n)$ implementation via prefix sums and a pruning criterion that avoids unnecessary quartic solves. The method returns all proximal points when the prox is non-unique, and in experiments it attains strictly lower objective values than approaches that guess sparsity or rely on sphere projections with limited scalability.",

We first extend the filter method for uniform Fourier data to the non-uniform setting by using the techniques of admissible frames. We show that the proposed non-uniform filter method converges exponentially away from the jump discontinuities. However, the convergence rate is significantly slower near the jump discontinuities due to the Gibbs phenomenon. To overcome this issue, we combine the non-uniform filter method with a stable extrapolation method to recover the function values near the jump discontinuities. We show that the proposed hybrid method could achieve exponential accuracy uniformly on the entire domain. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.",

This algorithm can be interpreted as the geometric integration on spheres, that a priori satisfy the unit length constraint of the normalized magnetization vector. Even though the geometric structures for this are obvious and some works already use an exponential algorithm, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no canonical structure of the LLG equation for the exponential update algorithm in micromagnetism. Tensor algebraic reformulations of the LLG equation allow the canonical representation of the evolution equation for the magnetization, which serves as the basis for different integrators. Based on the specific structure of the exponential of skew symmetric matrices an efficient update scheme is derived. The excellent performance of the proposed exponential update algorithm is demonstrated in representative examples.",

We first make this noise-independence principle precise in continuous time for multimode bosonic Gaussian Markov semigroups: for Hurwitz drift, a time-independent Gaussian similarity fixed by the Lyapunov equation gauges away diffusion for all times, so eigenvalues and non-diagonalizability are controlled entirely by the drift, while diffusion determines steady states and the structure of eigenoperators. We then extend the same separation to discrete time for general stable multimode bosonic Gaussian channels: for any stable Gaussian channel, we construct an explicit Gaussian similarity transformation that gauges away diffusion at the level of the channel parametrization. We illustrate the method with a single-mode squeezed-reservoir Lindbladian and with a non-Markovian family of single-mode Gaussian channels, where the exceptional-point manifolds and the associated gauging covariances can be obtained analytically.",

This paper solves the fundamental stability and large-time behavior problem on the anisotropic Navier-Stokes with fractional dissipation $Λ_1^{2s}$ for all $0\\leq s<1$.

    "abstract": "We study the projective geometry of algebraic neural layers, namely families of maps induced by a polynomial activation function, with particular emphasis on the generic Euclidean Distance degree ($\\mathrm{gED}$). This invariant is projective in nature and measures the number of optimal approximations of a general point in the ambient space with respect to a general metric. For a fixed architecture (i.e. fixed width and activation polynomial), we prove that the $\\mathrm{gED}$ is stably polynomial in the dimensions of the input and output spaces. Moreover, we show that this stable polynomial depends only on the degree of the activation function.   Our approach relies on standard intersection theory on the Nash blow-up, which allows us to express the $\\gED$ as an intersection number over products of Grassmannians. Stable polynomiality is deduced via equivariant localization, while the reduction to the monomial case follows from an explicit Schubert calculus computation on Grassmannians.",

    "title": "Fully Functional Weighted Testing for Abrupt and Gradual Location Changes in Functional Time Series",
    "abstract": "Change point tests for abrupt changes in the mean of functional data, i.e., random elements in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, are either based on dimension reduction techniques, e.g., based on principal components, or directly based on a functional CUSUM (cumulative sum) statistic. The former have often been criticized as not being fully functional and losing too much information. On the other hand, unlike the latter, they take the covariance structure of the data into account by weighting the CUSUM statistics obtained after dimension reduction with the inverse covariance matrix. In this paper, as a middle ground between these two approaches, we propose an alternative statistic that includes the covariance structure with an offset parameter to produce a scale-invariant test procedure and to increase power when the change is not aligned with the first components. We obtain the asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis for this new test statistic, allowing for time dependence of the data. Furthermore, we introduce versions of all three test statistics for gradual change situations, which have not been previously considered for functional data, and derive their limit distribution. Further results shed light on the asymptotic power behavior for all test statistics under various ground truths for the alternatives.",

In addition, we observe that a crucial property of $Γ_2$ on Cartesian products does no longer hold for $Γ_2^p$ in the case of $p > 2$. As a consequence, an analogous proof that non-negative curvature is preserved under taking Cartesian products is not possible for $p > 2$.",

However, scenarios involving asymmetric constraints, non-stationary boundary conditions, and active position constraints pose significant challenges. This paper provides a complete characterization of time-optimal switching surfaces for the problem, leading to novel insights into the geometric and algebraic structure of the optimal control. The active condition of position constraints is derived, which is absent from the literature. An efficient algorithm is proposed, capable of planning time-optimal trajectories under asymmetric full constraints and arbitrary boundary states, with a 100% success rate. Computational time for each trajectory is within approximately 10μs, achieving a 5-order-of-magnitude reduction compared to optimization-based baselines.",

Starting from an a priori bound on the orbit of iterates, we derive non-asymptotic estimates for the fixed-point residuals. These bounds are tight, meaning that they are attained by a suitable Lipschitz map and an associated Halpern sequence. By minimizing these tight bounds we identify the minimax-optimal Halpern scheme. For contractions, the optimal iteration exhibits a transition from an initial Halpern phase to the classical Banach-Picard iteration and, as the Lipschitz constant approaches one, we recover the known convergence rate for nonexpansive maps. For expansive maps, the algorithm is purely Halpern with no Banach-Picard phase; moreover, on bounded domains, the residual estimates converge to the minimal displacement bound. Inspired by the minimax-optimal iteration, we design an adaptive scheme whose residuals are uniformly smaller than the minimax-optimal bounds, and can be significantly sharper in practice. Finally, we extend the analysis by introducing alternative bounds based on the distance to a fixed point, which allow us to handle mappings on unbounded domains; including the case of affine maps for which we also identify the minimax-optimal iteration.",

    "abstract": "Real-time fluid and aeroacoustic simulation on complex surfaces can have interactive applications - from globe-based weather visualizations to immersive computer games with physically accurate wind and sound. However, conventional grid-based solvers struggle with numerical instability near surface singularities, and mesh-based approaches lack a straightforward path to solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with stable, high-order accuracy.   Our model presents a unified framework for real-time inviscid fluid simulation and aeroacoustics on spherical surfaces with embedded obstacles, combining the Closest Point Method (CPM), projection-based Navier-Stokes solvers, and the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FWH) analogy. CPM enables surface PDEs to be solved in a Cartesian embedding without parametrization by restricting computation to a narrow band around the sphere. Each band point is mapped to its nearest surface location, where band operators project results onto the local tangent space. Surface obstacles are modelled with signed distance functions (SDFs), enforcing no-slip velocity constraints and Bernoulli-based pressure adjustments for consistent real-world boundary interactions. Aeroacoustic sources are computed directly from surface pressure force derivatives and mapped to real-time audio via frequency and amplitude modulation with artifact-suppressing hysteresis smoothing.   Our findings from this model simulate the behaviour of inviscid fluid on spherical surfaces while generating sound using the pressure of the fluid flowing on the surface. This approach gives results that offer stability, geometric consistency, and support applications in scientific visualization, virtual reality, and educational tools.",

    "abstract": "Spherical spin glasses are canonical models for smooth random functions in high dimensions. In this review, we survey several interrelated lines of research on their geometric structure. We begin with results concerning critical points and their relationship to the Gibbs measure. For the pure models, the measure concentrates on spherical bands around critical points that approximately maximize the energy at a particular radius. Next, we present another approach in which a similar picture is derived for general mixed models. At the core of this approach is a free energy functional computed over bands using multiple orthogonal replicas, satisfying a strong concentration of measure. We discuss several implications of this method for a generalized Thouless-Anderson-Palmer (TAP) approach. Finally, we explain how these geometric insights inform optimization algorithms, and briefly relate them to Smale's 17th problem over the real numbers.",

    "abstract": "We consider a general class of round-robin tournament models of equally strong players. In these models, each of the $n$ players competes against every other player exactly once. For each match between two players, the outcome is a value from a countable subset of the unit interval, and the scores of the two players in a match sum to one. The final score of each player is defined as the sum of the scores obtained in matches against all other players. We study the distribution of extreme scores, including the maximum, second maximum, and lower-order extremes. Since the exact distribution is computationally intractable even for small values of $n$, we derive asymptotic results as the number of players $n$ tends to infinity, including limiting distributions, and rates of convergence.",

The solution of a boundary-value problem for a stationary Schrödinger equation on the unit ball can be studied from a variational perspective. In this variational formulation, a Sobolev inner product naturally arises. As test functions, we consider the linear space of the polynomials satisfying the boundary conditions on the sphere, and a basis of mutually orthogonal polynomials with respect to the Sobolev inner product is provided. The basis of the proposed method is given in terms of spherical harmonics and univariate Sobolev orthogonal polynomials. The connection formula between these Sobolev orthogonal polynomials and the classical orthogonal polynomials on the ball is established. Consequently, the Sobolev Fourier coefficients of a function satisfying the boundary value problem are recursively derived. Finally, one numerical experiment is presented.",

We demonstrate that the long-time behavior of $u$ converges to a shifted shock profile $U(x-st-d(t))$, where $d(t)$ is governed by the boundary layer dynamics at $x=0$ and driven by the initial data $u(x,0)$. To overcome the singularity from fast diffusion compounded by the bad effect of boundary layer for wave stability, some new techniques for weighted energy estimates are introduced artfully.",

We then extend this framework to the equivariant setting. For any Lie groupoid equipped with an action by a coherent 2-group, we introduce the bicategory of 2-equivariant 2-vector bundles over it. This leads to the definition of 2-equivariant 2K-theory as the Grothendieck group of the internal equivalence classes in the bicategory. Furthermore, we define a higher analogue of orbifold, which generalizes Lie groupoids with a 2-group action, and construct the bicategory of 2-orbifold 2-vector bundles.

The rotations involved are discretized using suitable quadrature rules. This framework includes classical constructions such as spherical needlets and directional wavelet systems, and at the same time permits the systematic design of new frames with adjustable spatial localization, directional sensitivity, and computational complexity. We show that a number of frame properties can be characterized in terms of simple, easily verifiable conditions on the Fourier coefficients of the functions $Ψ^j$. Extending an earlier result for zonal systems, we establish sufficient conditions under which the frame functions are optimally localized in space with respect to a spherical uncertainty principle, thus making the corresponding systems a viable tool for position-frequency analyses. To conclude this article, we explicitly discuss examples of well-localized and highly directional polynomial frames.",

To fit the model, we develop a pseudo-observation-based procedure yielding consistent and asymptotically normal coefficient estimates. In addition, we propose bootstrap-based hypothesis tests to infer the effects of the covariates on the relative treatment effect. A simulation study compares the novel method to Cox regression, demonstrating that the proposed hypothesis tests have high power and keep up with the z-test of the Cox model even in scenarios where the latter is specified correctly.

We introduce a new criterion based on a polynomial greatest common divisor condition that provides a lower bound on the number of visible lattice points in N^2. Conversely, we derive conditions under which a given lattice point becomes the next visible point along such a polynomial curve. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we also obtain an exact double-sum formula for the number of pairs (a, b) less than or equal to N that are visible with respect to this polynomial family.

The main goal is to develop the Riemann-Hilbert formalism for this problem, paying a particular attention to the case of the ``pure oscillating step'' initial data, that is $u(x,0)=0$ for $x<0$ and $u(x,0)=A\\cos(2Bx)$ for $x\\geq0$. Also, we derive three new families of two-soliton solutions, which correspond to the values of $A$ and $B$ satisfying $B<\\frac{A}{4}$, $B>\\frac{A}{4}$, and $B=\\frac{A}{4}$.",

Our main result shows that much of the general theory of multipliers is approachable through the theory of unimodular multipliers. Indeed, we show that a bounded measurable function $m$ is a multiplier on $L^p$ for $1\\leq p<\\infty$ if and only if $e^{itm}$ is a multiplier on $L^p$ and its multiplier norm admits an exponential bound of the form $e^{c|t|^s}$ for suitable $c>0$ and $0<s<1$. We then apply this principle to obtain new results related to the boundedness of homogeneous rough operators, singular operators along curves and oscillatory integrals. A key ingredient in our study is an extension of the classical Stein's theorem on analytic families of operators that studies the behaviour of the derivative operator when $θ\\to 0$.",

This framework allows us to reduce involved topological problems to discrete problems regarding the subgroup structure and representation theory of the group $G$. Our main result is an example of this: we classify the $G$-universes $\\mathcal{U}$ for which the linear isometries operad $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{U})$ and the infinite little discs operad $\\mathcal{D}(\\mathcal{U})$ are homotopically equivalent. To achieve this, we use ideas that originate from the work of Balchin-Barnes-Roitzheim on the combinatorics of transfer systems on a total order. Additionally, the use of transfer systems gives us insight into the algebraic structures that arise from equivariant homotopy theory. Compatible pairs of transfer systems provide rules for when multiplicative transfer maps can be paired with additive transfer maps. In the case that the group $G$ is abelian, we provide conditions for when the pair $(\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{U}),\\mathcal{D}(\\mathcal{U}))$ defines a maximally compatible pair of transfer systems.

The method enables stable source reconstructions where conventional approaches fail due to ill-posedness, with potential applications in medical imaging and non-destructive testing. Key contributions include:   1. Implementation of a theoretically justified asymptotic expansion, from [33], using the eigensystem of the Newtonian operator, with error analysis for the spectral truncation.   2. Novel numerical schemes for solving the time-domain Lippmann-Schwinger equation and reconstructing the source via Riesz basis expansions and mollification-based numerical differentiations.   3. Reconstruction requiring only single-point measurements, overcoming traditional spatial data limitations.   4. 3D numerical experiments demonstrating accurate source recovery under noise (SNR of the order $1/a$), with error analysis for the droplet size (of the order $a$) and the number of spectral modes $N$.",

For spreading bases (which need not be unconditional or even Schauder bases), we develop new techniques involving the geometry of spreading sequences and their associated spreading models. We prove that any spreading basis is automatically seminormalized, M-bounded, and uniformly spreading, which allows the construction of an isometric renorming via its spreading model. For symmetric bases, we show they are necessarily spreading and uniformly symmetric, enabling a direct application of a renorming lemma for uniformly bounded semigroups of operators. Consequently, any quasi-Banach space with a symmetric basis admits a renorming making all permutations isometries, and any spreading basis admits a renorming making all increasing maps isometries. These results extend and unify classical isometric renorming theorems for unconditional, subsymmetric, and symmetric Schauder bases to the conditional, non-Schauder setting.",

In this paper, we study the graph obtained from the shuriken operation and examine how its properties depend on those of the base graph. In particular, we investigate several graph invariants, including the clique number, chromatic number, independence number, and domination number.

    "abstract": "We study the mode transition algebras and Zhu algebras in the setting of $\\mathbb{Z}$-graded vertex algebras, with particular focus on the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 (also known as bosonic ghosts or the $βγ$-system). We show that the mode transition algebras of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 admit unity elements that form a family of strong unities in the sense of Damiolini-Gibney-Krashen. The existence of unities for the mode transition algebra of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 allows us to explicitly construct all higher level Zhu algebras of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2. We further analyze weak modules of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 induced from Zhu algebras, proving that every such module is already induced from the level-zero Zhu algebra. We then prove that all indecomposable reducible weight modules induced from a Zhu algebra are not weakly interlocked, and hence not strongly interlocked in the sense of Barron-Batistelli-Orosz Hunziker-Yamskulna. More generally, we show that the property of being weakly interlocked is preserved under the action of an invertible Li's $\\mathbfΔ$ operator. As an application, we prove that all indecomposable reducible weight modules of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 obtained via spectral flow of Zhu-induced modules are likewise not weakly interlocked.

We then demonstrate that finite nuclear dimension (respectively, absorption of a strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra) is preserved under the formation of crossed products by residually compact group actions with finite Rokhlin dimension (respectively, finite Rokhlin dimension with commuting towers). Furthermore, if second countable residually compact group contains a non-open cocompact closed subgroup, then crossed products arising from actions with finite Rokhlin dimension are stable. Finally, we study the relationship between the tube dimension of a topological dynamical system and the Rokhlin dimension of the induced C*-dynamical system.",

    "abstract": "Pose graph optimization (PGO) is fundamental to robot perception and navigation systems, serving as the mathematical backbone for solving simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Existing solvers suffer from polynomial growth in computational complexity with graph size, hindering real-time deployment in large-scale scenarios. In this paper, by duplicating variables and introducing equality constraints, we reformulate the problem and propose a Parallelizable Riemannian Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (PRADMM) to solve it efficiently. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods that usually exhibit polynomial time complexity growth with graph size, PRADMM enables efficient parallel computation across vertices regardless of graph size. Crucially, all subproblems admit closed-form solutions, ensuring PRADMM maintains exceptionally stable performance. Furthermore, by carefully exploiting the structures of the coefficient matrices in the constraints, we establish the global convergence of PRADMM under mild conditions, enabling larger relaxation step sizes within the interval $(0,2)$. Extensive empirical validation on two synthetic datasets and multiple real-world 3D SLAM benchmarks confirms the superior computational performance of PRADMM.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a 3-dimensional free boundary problem modeling tumor growth with the Robin boundary condition. The system involves a positive parameter $μ$ which reflects the intensity of tumor aggressiveness. Huang, Zhang and Hu [Nonlinear Anal. Real World Appl. 2017(35), 483-502] have shown that for each $μ_n$ ($n$ even) in a strictly increasing sequence $\\{ μ_n \\}(n\\geq 2)$, there exists a stationary bifurcation solution $(σ_n(\\varepsilon),p_n(\\varepsilon),r_n(\\varepsilon))$ with $μ= μ_n(\\varepsilon)$ bifurcating from $μ_n$. We first derive that the bifurcation curve $(r_2(\\varepsilon),μ_2(\\varepsilon))$ exhibits a transcritical bifurcation with $μ_2'(0)<0$. Moreover, we show that the stationary bifurcation solution $(σ_2(\\varepsilon),p_2(\\varepsilon),r_2(\\varepsilon))$ is linearly unstable for small $|\\varepsilon|$ under non-radially symmetric perturbations. In contrast to the linear stability of the radially symmetric stationary solution, the lack of explicit expressions for bifurcation solutions adds great difficulty in analyzing their linear stability. The novelty of this paper lies in the use of the bifurcation curve's structure to overcome the above difficulties. Moreover, this linear stability result is not established using the standard method, due to an eight-dimensional generalized kernel at eigenvalue 0 for the linearized operator.",

We also provide a complete characterization of the optimal policy for Markovian systems with two stations and two servers when each server's efficiency may be task dependent. We show that the throughput is maximized under the policy which assigns one server to each station (based on their relative skill at that station) unless station 2 has no work (in which case both servers work at station 1) or the number of customers in the buffer reaches a threshold whose value we characterize (in which case both servers work at station 2). We study how the optimal policy varies with the level of server synergy (including no synergy) and also compare the optimal policy for systems with different customer abandonment rates (including no abandonments). Finally, we investigate the case where the synergy among collaborating servers can be task-dependent and provide numerical results.",

Each failed attempt adds pressure on the pitcher to avoid using another, and the runner can intensify this pressure by extending their leadoff toward the next base. We model this dynamic as a two-player zero-sum sequential game in which the runner first chooses a lead distance, and then the pitcher chooses whether to attempt a pickoff. We establish optimality characterizations for the game and present variants of value iteration and policy iteration to solve the game. Using lead distance data, we estimate generalized linear mixed-effects models for pickoff and stolen base outcome probabilities given lead distance, context, and player skill. We compute the game-theoretic equilibria under the two-player model, as well as the optimal runner policy under a simplified one-player Markov decision process (MDP) model. In the one-player setting, our results establish an actionable rule of thumb: the Two-Foot Rule, which recommends that a runner increase their lead by two feet after each pickoff attempt.",

    "title": "The second Delannoy category",
    "abstract": "In recent work, Harman and Snowden constructed a symmetric tensor category associated to an oligomorphic group equipped with a measure. The oligomorphic group $\\mathbb{G}$ of order preserving automorphisms of the real line admits exactly four measures. The category $\\mathcal{C}$ associated to the first measure is called the (first) Delannoy category; it is semi-simple and pre-Tannakian, with numerous special properties.   In this paper, we study the (non-abelian) category $\\mathcal{A}$ associated to the second measure, which we call the second Delannoy category. We construct a new pre-Tannakian category $\\mathcal{D}$ together with a fully faithful tensor functor $Ψ\\colon \\mathcal{A} \\to \\mathcal{D}$. The category $\\mathcal{D}$ is the correct ``abelian version'' of the second Delannoy category. Like $\\mathcal{C}$, it has remarkable properties: for instance, it is non-semi-simple, but behaves uniformly in the coefficient field (e.g., it has the same Grothendieck ring and $\\mathrm{Ext}^1$ quiver over any field).   Additionally, we completely solve the problem of understanding how $\\mathcal{A}$ relates to general pre-Tannakian categories. We show that $\\mathcal{A}$ admits exactly two local abelian envelopes: the functor $Ψ$, and a previously constructed functor $Φ\\colon \\mathcal{A} \\to \\mathcal{C}$. This is the first case where the local envelopes of a category have been completely determined, outside of cases where there is at most one envelope. This work opens the door to constructing abelian versions of other oligomorphic tensor categories that do not admit a unique envelope.",

The ZK equation admits three scalar conserved quantities -- mass, momentum, and energy -- represented as $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$, as well as a vector-valued quantity $\\bm{I}_4$. In high-accuracy numerical simulations on a finite double-periodic domain, most of these quantities are well preserved, while a systematic temporal drift is observed only in the $x$-component $I_{4x}$. We show that the nontrivial evolution of $I_{4x}$ originates from an explicit boundary-flux contribution, which is induced by fluctuations of the solution and its spatial derivatives at the domain boundaries. We successfully identify the source of the inaccuracy in the numerical solutions. Motivated by this analysis, we define a modified center-of-mass quantity $I_{4x}^{\\mathrm{mod}}$ and demonstrate its conservation numerically for single-pulse configurations. The modified quantity thus provides a consistent conservation law for the ZK equation and yields an appropriate description of center-of-mass motion in finite-domain numerical simulations.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the computability of $\\mathcal{G}$-Bernoulli measures, with a particular focus on measures of maximal entropy (MMEs) on coded shift spaces. Coded shifts are natural generalizations of sofic shifts and are defined as the closure of all bi-infinite concatenations of words (generators) drawn from a countable generating set $\\mathcal{G}$. We begin by establishing a computability criterion for $\\mathcal{G}$-Bernoulli measures which are invariant measures given by assigning probability weights to the generators. We then apply this criterion to the setting in which the concatenation entropy exceeds the residual entropy, showing that in this case the unique measure of maximal entropy $μ_{\\rm max}$ on $X$ is computable, provided the Vere--Jones parameter $κ$ of $\\mathcal{G}$ is computable, based on having oracle access to the generators and the language of $X$. As a consequence, the unique MME is computable for several well-known classes of shift spaces, including $S$-gap shifts, multiple-gap shifts, and $β$-shifts. Moreover, the two ergodic MMEs of the Dyck shift are also computable. Finally, we examine the opposite situation, where the residual entropy exceeds the concatenation entropy and the MME is known to be non-unique in general. We show that even when $μ_{\\rm max}$ is unique and the parameter $κ$ is computable, the measure $μ_{\\rm max}$ may still fail to be computable.",

    "abstract": "Tangent category theory is a well-established categorical framework for differential geometry. A long list of fundamental geometric constructions, such as the tangent bundle functor, vector fields, Euclidean spaces, and vector bundles have been successfully generalized and internalized within tangent categories. Over the past decade, the theory has also been extended in several directions, yielding concepts such as tangent monads, tangent fibrations, tangent restriction categories, and reverse tangent categories. It is natural to wonder how these new flavours of the theory interact with the geometric constructions. How does a tangent monad or a tangent fibration lift to the tangent category of differential bundles of a tangent category? What is the correct notion of connections for a tangent restriction category? In previous work, we introduced tangentads, a unifying framework that generalizes many tangent-like notions, and developed a formal theory of vector fields for tangentads. In this paper, we extend this formal theory to three further fundamental constructions. These are differential objects, which generalize Euclidean spaces, differential bundles, which represent vector bundles in tangent category theory, and connections on differential bundles, which are the analogue of Koszul connections. These notions are introduced in the general theory of tangentads via appropriate universal properties. We then extend some of the main results of tangent category theory, including the equivalence between differential objects and differential bundles over the terminal object, and show that connections admit well-defined notions of covariant derivative, curvature, and torsion. Finally, we construct connections using PIE limits and apply our framework to several concrete instances of tangentads.",

Using the theory of maps on surfaces, cellular $4$--regular torus projections are encoded by permutation pairs $(α,σ)$, and unsensed projection classes are enumerated completely and without duplication via canonical representatives. For a fixed projection, crossing assignments are encoded by bit data, and an immediate Reidemeister~II reduction supported by a bigon face is characterized directly in terms of these bits. The genus-one generalized Kauffman-type bracket is then evaluated as a state sum entirely within the permutation model, without drawing diagrams in a fundamental polygon.   The implementation is validated against published genus-one classifications for $N\\le 5$ under explicit comparison conventions, with remaining discrepancies explained at the level of global conventions. Beyond the published range, we compute projection and diagram data for crossing numbers up to $N=8$ and provide a public reference implementation together with machine-readable datasets.

    "abstract": "Strong, correlated noise in recurrent neural circuits often passes through nonlinear transfer functions, complicating dynamical mean-field analyses of complex phenomena such as transients and bifurcations. We introduce a method that replaces nonlinear functions of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noise with a Gaussian-equivalent process matched in mean and covariance, and combine this with a lognormal moment closure for expansive nonlinearities to derive a closed dynamical mean-field theory for recurrent neuronal networks. The resulting theory captures order-one transients, fixed points, and noise-induced shifts of bifurcation structure, and outperforms standard linearization-based approximations in the strong-fluctuation regime. More broadly, the approach applies whenever dynamics depend smoothly on OU processes via nonlinear transformations, offering a tractable route to noise-dependent phase diagrams in computational neuroscience models.",

This class of problems contains constrained convex non-smooth optimization problems, constrained saddle-point problems and various equilibrium problems in economics and engineering. In order to respect constraints we adopt a penalty approach, introducing an explicit time-dependency into the evolution system. The resulting dynamics are described in terms of a non-autonomous stochastic evolution equation governed by maximally monotone operators in the drift and perturbed by a Brownian motion. We study the asymptotic behavior, as well as finite time convergence rates in terms of gap functions. The condition we use to prove convergence involves a Legendre transform of the function describing the set C, a condition first used by Attouch and Czarnecki (J. Differ. Equations, Vol. 248, Issue 6, 2010) in the context of deterministic evolution equations. We also establish a large deviations principle showing that individual trajectories exhibit exponential concentration around the solution set.

He proved that weakly closed binomial edge ideals are F-pure whenever the base field has positive characteristic. He conjectured that: (i) when the base field has characteristic two, every F-pure binomial edge ideal comes from a weakly closed graph; and (ii) that every binomial edge ideal is F-pure provided that the characteristic of the residue field is sufficiently large.   In this paper, we resolve both of Matsuda's conjectures. We confirm Matsuda's first conjecture, showing that the binomial edge ideal of a graph defines an F-pure quotient in characteristic 2 if and only if the graph is weakly closed. We also show that Matsuda's second conjecture is false in a very strong way by showing that graphs containing asteroidal triples, such as the net, define non-F-pure binomial edge ideals in any positive characteristic. Our results yield a complete classification of F-pure binomial edge ideals of chordal graphs as well as large families of standard graded algebras that are F-injective but neither F-pure nor F-rational in all characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Certain families of quantum mechanical models can be described and solved efficiently on a classical computer, including qubit or qudit Clifford circuits and stabilizer codes, free-boson or free-fermion models, and certain rotor and GKP codes. We show that all of these families can be described as instances of the same algebraic structure, namely quadratic functions over abelian groups, or more generally over (super) Hopf algebras. Different kinds of degrees of freedom correspond to different \"elementary\" abelian groups or Hopf algebras: $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ for qubits, $\\mathbb{Z}_d$ for qudits, $\\mathbb{R}$ for continuous variables, both $\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z}$ for rotors, and a super Hopf algebra $\\mathcal F$ for fermionic modes. Objects such as states, operators, superoperators, or projection-operator valued measures, etc, are tensors. For the solvable models above, these tensors are quadratic tensors based on quadratic functions. Quadratic tensors with $n$ degrees of freedom are fully specified by only $O(n^2)$ coefficients. Tensor networks of quadratic tensors can be contracted efficiently on the level of these coefficients, using an operation reminiscent of the Schur complement. Our formalism naturally includes models with mixed degrees of freedom, such as qudits of different dimensions. We also use quadratic functions to define generalized stabilizer codes and Clifford gates for arbitrary abelian groups. Finally, we give a generalization from quadratic (or 2nd order) to $i$th order tensors, which are specified by $O(n^i)$ coefficients but cannot be contracted efficiently in general.",

This paper makes the first steps in investigating this behavior in the generalised case of cluster algebras from orbifolds; determining when such surfaces admit a diagram with a maximal green sequence. Specifically, we will provide a triangulation for the orientable surfaces of genus $n$ with an arbitrary number of orbifold points and arbitrary number of punctures, determine when it has a maximal green sequence, and construct one if it exists.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a family of generalized Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonians, which are reverse-engineered to have an arbitrary edge-weighted superposition of dimer coverings as their exact ground state at the RK point. We then focus on a quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice, with doubly-periodic edge weights. For simplicity we consider a $2\\times1$ periodic model in which all weights are set to one except for a tunable horizontal edge weight labeled $α$. We analytically show that the model exhibits a continuous quantum phase transition at $α=3$, changing from a topological $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid ($α<3$) to a columnar ordered state ($α>3$). The dimer-dimer correlator decays exponentially on both sides of the transition with the correlation length $ξ\\propto1/|α-3|$ and as a power-law at criticality. The vison correlator exhibits an exponential decay in the spin liquid phase, but becomes a constant in the ordered phase. We explain the constant vison correlator in terms of loops statistics of the double-dimer model. Using finite-size scaling of the vison correlator, we extract critical exponents consistent with the 2D Ising universality class.",

    "abstract": "An integer program is called ideal if its continuous relaxation coincides with its convex hull allowing the problem to be solved as a continuous program and offering substantial computational advantages. Proving idealness analytically can be extraordinarily tedious -- even for small formulations -- such proofs often span many pages of intricate case analysis which motivates the development of automated verification methods. We develop a general-purpose framework for certifying idealness in Mixed Binary Linear Programs (MBLPs), formulating the verification problem as a linear program when the data is fixed and as a nonconvex quadratic program when the data is parametric. We apply this framework to study several formulations of the rectangle packing problem that are conjectured to be pairwise-ideal, obtaining computational proofs where analytic proofs were previously unknown or impractical. As our second contribution, we introduce and model a novel generalization of the rectangle packing problem that enforces edge clearances between selected rectangles. We present both existing and novel MBLP formulations which arise from different encodings of the underlying disjunctive constraints. We perform some computational experiments on these formulations under a strip-packing objective to determine the importance of pairwise-idealness in practice.",

    "abstract": "The classic upper bound on the chromatic number of $d$-degenerate graphs is $d+1$, shown to be tight by complete graphs. A natural question is whether this bound remains tight if one forbids large cliques. Classic constructions of Tutte and Zykov from the early 50s show that there exist $d$-degenerate $(d+1)$-chromatic graphs that are triangle-free, however these constructions grow rapidly with $d$. Motivated by this and addressing a problem posed by the second author at the Oberwolfach Graph Theory workshop, we prove that the minimum order $f(d)$ of a $d$-degenerate triangle-free graph of chromatic number $d+1$ satisfies $e^{Ω(d)}\\le f(d)\\le e^{O(d^2\\log d)}.$ The lower bound follows from a novel upper bound on the chromatic number of triangle-free graphs: Every triangle-free $d$-degenerate graph $G$ on $n \\le e^{O(d)}$ vertices satisfies $$χ(G)\\le O\\left(\\frac{d}{\\log\\left(d/\\log n\\right)}\\right).$$ We extend this to a more general result about degenerate graphs with sparse neighborhoods, which has applications to many graph coloring problems: For example, we prove that every counterexample to Hadwiger's conjecture with parameter $t$ must have a complete bipartite subgraph with one exponentially large side ($K_{a,b}$ where $a=(\\log t)^{1/2-o(1)}$ and $b=e^{t^{1-o(1)}}$) or a small and very dense subgraph (of order $\\le t$ with $t^{2-o(1)}$ edges) in some neighborhood.   For the upper bound on $f(d)$ we establish a surprising connection between $f(d)$ and the on-line-chromatic number $g(n)$ of $n$-vertex triangle-free graphs. We also give an asymptotic improvement of the previous best upper bound for $g(n)$ due to Lovász, Saks and Trotter from 1989.   Along the way we disprove a generalization of Harris' fractional coloring conjecture to graphs of bounded clique number and raise numerous problems which open up interesting directions to explore for future research.",

In 1957, just one year later, J. Nash independently developed analogous techniques for parabolic equations, concurrently with De Giorgi's research. By the year 2000, these techniques had been extended to address elliptic and parabolic equations featuring integral diffusion, such as the fractional Laplacian. More recently, the theory has evolved to encompass kinetic equations, accommodating both local and integral diffusions. This book aims to present these results in a unified and coherent manner, beginning with the classical elliptic framework and progressing through to the most recent advancements in kinetic equations.",

Straightfoward exact solutions exist when the evolution is described by a linear differential equation, corresponding to constant, linear, and quadratic potentials. In the nonlinear case, exact solutions are derived for $V = V_0\\ln φ$, $V = V_0 φ^{1/2}$ and $V = V_0/φ$, and the logarithmic potential also yields an exact first integral. These complicated parametric solutions are considerably less useful than those derived previously for a universe dominated by a barotropic fluid such as matter or radiation with $w_B > -1$. However, we generalize the slow-roll approximation and show that it applies to all sufficiently flat potentials in the case of a vacuum-dominated expansion, while it never applies when the universe is dominated by a background fluid with $w_B > -1$.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates a stochastic version of a class of non-Newtonian fluids governed by third-grade fluid equations, which exhibit complex and highly nonlinear dynamics. In particular, we address the random dynamics and asymptotic behavior of stochastic third-grade fluid equations (STGFEs) driven by a \\emph{linear multiplicative Itô-type white noise} on general domains $\\mathbb{Q}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\\in\\{2,3\\}$. We first prove that the non-autonomous STGFEs generate a continuous non-autonomous random dynamical system $Φ$, and we establish the existence of a pullback absorbing set. Using compact Sobolev embeddings on bounded domains and uniform tail estimates on unbounded domains, we show the pullback asymptotic compactness of $Φ$, which leads to the existence of pullback random attractors that are compact and attracting in $\\mathbb{L}^2(\\mathbb{Q})$. As a consequence, we demonstrate the existence of an invariant measure associated with the STGFEs and, exploiting the linear multiplicative structure of the noise along with the exponential stability of solutions, we prove uniqueness of the invariant measure in the case of zero external forcing. These results are entirely new for STGFEs on general domains, and, in particular, the existence of pullback random attractors with linear multiplicative noise is obtained here for the first time. We further note that, unlike Stratonovich noise, which is widely used in the literature to study random attractors, Itô noise is more appropriate for domains that do not satisfy the Poincaré inequality. Overall, this work resolves several open problems regarding random attractors, invariant measures, and ergodicity for stochastic third-grade fluids on general unbounded domains $\\mathbb{Q}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\\in\\{2,3\\}$.",

    "title": "A height-based metaconcept for rooted tree balance and its implications for the $B_1$ index",
    "abstract": "Tree balance has received considerable attention in recent years, both in phylogenetics and in other areas. Numerous (im)balance indices have been proposed to quantify the (im)balance of rooted trees. A recent comprehensive survey summarized this literature and showed that many existing indices are based on similar underlying principles. To unify these approaches, three general metaconcepts were introduced, providing a framework to classify, analyze, and extend imbalance indices. In this context, a metaconcept is a function $Φ_f$ that depends on another function $f$ capturing some aspect of tree shape. In this manuscript, we extend this line of research by introducing a new metaconcept based on the heights of the pending subtrees of all inner vertices. We provide a thorough analysis of this metaconcept and use it to answer open questions concerning the well-known $B_1$ balance index. In particular, we characterize the tree shapes that maximize the $B_1$ index in two cases: (i) arbitrary rooted trees and (ii) binary rooted trees. For both cases, we also determine the corresponding maximum values of the index.   Finally, while the $B_1$ index is induced by a so-called third-order metaconcept, we explicitly introduce three new (im)balance indices derived from the first- and second-order height metaconcepts, respectively, thereby demonstrating that pending subtree heights give rise to a variety of novel (im)balance indices.",

We first show that when the external forcing is sufficiently small, the global attractor of the underlying system (which characterizes its asymptotic behavior) reduces to a single point. We then consider the system under stochastic perturbations, specifically infinite-dimensional additive white noise. In this random setting, we do not find conclusive evidence that the corresponding random attractor remains a single point, as in the deterministic case. However, we are able to estimate the rate at which the random attractor approaches the deterministic singleton attractor as the intensity of the stochastic noise tends to zero.",

We also prove complementary upper bounds for first eigenvalues in the closed and Robin settings, including rigidity in the curvature-corrected case, and we establish Steklov-type estimates in a coercive regime where the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator is well defined for all boundary data.",

This study presents a diffusion-based generative framework that incorporates a dedicated consistency constraint and advanced posterior sampling methods to ensure adherence to desired electromagnetic specifications. Through rigorous validation on small-scale metasurface configurations, the proposed approach demonstrates marked enhancements in both accuracy and reliability of the generated designs. Furthermore, we introduce a scalable methodology that extends inverse design capabilities to large-scale metasurfaces, validated for configurations of up to $98 \\times 98$ nanopillars. Notably, this approach enables rapid design generation completed in minute by leveraging models trained on substantially smaller arrays ($23 \\times 23$).

Our methods rely on a detailed analysis of core normalizers and their functorial behavior under algebra homomorphisms. Using the notion of actors between groupoids, we show that under natural hypotheses, embeddings between reduced $L^p$-groupoid algebras can be described entirely in terms of morphisms of the underlying groupoids. We further show that embeddings of $L^p$-groupoid algebras induce embeddings of the associated topological full groups. Our results provide new tools for studying embeddability questions in the $L^p$-setting, and are particularly helpful when ruling out the existence of embeddings.   As applications, we obtain strong rigidity results for (spatial) $L^p$-AF-embeddability, showing that, for $p\\neq 2$, an $L^p$-groupoid algebra embeds into a spatial $L^p$-AF-algebra if and only if the underlying groupoid is AF.

Originally introduced by Bryant as the verbal topology, it serves as a fundamental tool for investigating the topological structure of infinite groups and is always a $T_1$ topology with continuous shifts and inversion. Since the Zariski topology is coarser than every Hausdorff group topology on G, it provides a natural starting point for topologizing groups; specifically, for countable or abelian groups, it is known that the Zariski topology coincides with the Markov topology-the intersection of all Hausdorff group topologies on G.   In this paper, we analyze the Zariski topology on various homeomorphism groups. We demonstrate that for the Thompson groups F and T, the Zariski (and thus Markov) topology coincides with the standard compact-open topology derived from their respective actions on $[0,1]$ and $S^1$. In contrast, we show that the Zariski (and thus Markov) topology on Thompson's group V is irreducible, and therefore neither Hausdorff nor a group topology. As V acts highly transitively on each of its orbits, this result stands in notable opposition to a theorem by Banakh et al, which establishes that the Zariski topology on any permutation group containing all finitely supported elements is a Hausdorff group topology.   We also extend these investigations to Homeo$([0,1])$, Homeo$(S^1)$, and Homeo$(2^ω)$. We conclude by providing a classification of the topological manifolds $M$ for which the homeomorphism group Homeo$(M)$ admits a Hausdorff Zariski topology.",

    "abstract": "The first non-zero Laplace eigenvalue of a hyperbolic surface, or its spectral gap, measures how well-connected the surface is: surfaces with a large spectral gap are hard to cut in pieces, have a small diameter and fast mixing times. For large hyperbolic surfaces (of large area or large genus $g$, equivalently), we know that the spectral gap is asymptotically bounded above by $\\frac 14$. The aim of these talks is to present joint work with Nalini Anantharaman, where we prove that most hyperbolic surfaces have a near-optimal spectral gap. That is to say, we prove that, for any $ε> 0$, the Weil--Petersson probability for a hyperbolic surface of genus $g$ to have a spectral gap greater than $\\frac 14- ε$ goes to one as $g$ goes to infinity. This statement is analogous to Alon's 1986 conjecture for regular graphs, proven by Friedman in 2003. I will present our approach, which shares many similarities with Friedman's work, and introduce new tools and ideas that we have developed in order to tackle this problem.",

The evolution of the system is therefore determined by the choice of a constitutive characterization for these constraints, a choice that restores mechanical determinism and eliminates any paradoxical aspects of the system's behavior, in agreement with experimental evidence. It is shown that, similarly to what occurs in general non ideal impulsive systems, the choice of a constitutive characterization of the constraint system depends on the determination of two numerical coefficients $σ$ and $β$, which depend on the kinematic and mass-related data of the system, and possibly also on physical quantities not strictly of a mechanical nature, such as material properties. The simplicity of the model also allows for a straightforward experimental analysis of the system's behavior and for the experimental determination of the values of these coefficients.",

One of the most classical examples is the Livšic equation $$ v(x) = α\\circ F(x) - α(x).$$ The existence and regularity of its solutions $α$ is well understood when $F$ is a hyperbolic dynamical system (for instance an expanding map of the circle) and $v$ is a Hölder function.   The $\\textbf{twisted cohomological equation}$ $$ v(x) = α\\circ F(x) - (DF(x))^β\\, α(x) $$ is much less well understood. Functions similar to the famous Brjuno, Weierstrass, and Takagi functions appear as solutions of this equation. This functional equation also appears in the work of M. Lyubich, and of Avila, Lyubich, and de Melo in their study of deformations of quadratic-like and real-analytic maps.   Nevertheless, there are some striking results concerning the (lack of) regularity of solutions $α$ when $F$ is a linear endomorphism of the circle and $v$ is very regular. Notable contributions include works by Berry and Lewis; Ledrappier; Przytycki and Urbański, and more recently by Barański, Bárány and Romanowska, as well as by Shen, and by Ren and Shen, on Takagi and Weierstrass (and Weierstrass-like) functions.   We study the regularity of solutions $α$ when $F$ is a $\\textbf{nonlinear}$ expanding map of the circle and $v$ is not differentiable or even continuous, a setting in which previously used transversality techniques do not appear to be applicable. The new approach uses fractional derivatives to reduce the study of the twisted cohomological equation to that of a corresponding Livšic cohomological equation, and to show that the resulting distributional solutions (in the sense of Schwartz) satisfy certain Central Limit Theorem.",

We show that solutions to these equations have a partial regularity estimate which captures differences of the solution up to the scale at which the kernel has a truncation in its singularity. The estimates we provide are robust with respect to the truncation parameter, and they include the existing results for the original operators without truncation. There are some earlier results for linear and elliptic cases of this situation of integrable interaction kernels, and so our work is a generalization of those to the nonlinear and parabolic setting.",

    "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage or utilization (CCUS) will play an important role to achieve climate neutrality in many economies. Pipelines are widely regarded as the most efficient means of CO2 transport; however, they are currently non-existent. Policy-makers and companies need to develop large-scale infrastructure under substantial uncertainty. Methods and analyses are needed to support pipeline planning and strategy development. This paper presents an integrated method for designing CO2 pipeline networks by combining energy system scenarios with physical network simulation. Using Germany as a case study, we derive spatially highly resolved CO2 balances to develop a dense-phase CO2 pipeline topology that follows existing gas pipeline corridors. The analyzed system includes existing sites for cement and lime production, waste incineration, carbon users, four coastal CO2 hubs, and border crossing points. We then apply the multiphysical network simulator MYNTS to assess the technical feasibility of this network. We determine pipeline diameters, pump locations, and operating conditions that ensure stable dense-phase transport. The method explicitly accounts for elevation and possible impurities. The results indicate that a system of about 7000 km pipeline length and a mixed normed diameter of DN700 on main corridors and of DN500/DN400 on branches presents a feasible solution to connect most sites. Investment costs for the optimized pipeline system are calculated to be about 17 billion Euros. The method provides a reproducible framework and is transferable to other countries and to European scope.",

We propose a deviance-based statistic to estimate the expected relative entropy, prove that it is consistent and its asymptotic distribution can be approximated by a non-central chi-squared distribution. That enables the calculation of confidence intervals and p-values to assess the significance of the expected relative entropy for a given modality.

    "abstract": "Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are increasingly used to replace computationally demanding electronic-structure calculations to model matter at the atomic scale. The most commonly used model architectures are constrained to fulfill a number of physical laws exactly, from geometric symmetries to energy conservation. Evidence is mounting that relaxing some of these constraints can be beneficial to the efficiency and (somewhat surprisingly) accuracy of MLIPs, even though care should be taken to avoid qualitative failures associated with the breaking of physical symmetries. Given the recent trend of \\emph{scaling up} models to larger numbers of parameters and training samples, a very important question is how unconstrained MLIPs behave in this limit. Here we investigate this issue, showing that -- when trained on large datasets -- unconstrained models can be superior in accuracy and speed when compared to physically constrained models. We assess these models both in terms of benchmark accuracy and in terms of usability in practical scenarios, focusing on static simulation workflows such as geometry optimization and lattice dynamics. We conclude that accurate unconstrained models can be applied with confidence, especially since simple inference-time modifications can be used to recover observables that are consistent with the relevant physical symmetries.",

In comparison, our forward scheme achieves a gradual improvement of proposals that converges toward the proposal targeted by these backward methods. We show that backward approaches can be numerically unstable even in simple settings. Our forward method, however, offers significantly greater robustness with only a minor trade-off in performance, measured by the variance of the marginal likelihood estimator.

We propose a new stopping criterion for efficient termination and preventing long runs of sampling in the stationary post-convergence phase of the algorithm and discuss Monte Carlo sample size choice. We run a series of simulation comparisons of spatial statistical models alongside the popular integrated nested Laplacian approximation method and demonstrate potential for similar or improved estimator performance and reduced running times. We also consider scaling of the algorithms to large datasets and demonstrate a greater than 100-fold reduction in running times using modern GPU hardware to illustrate the feasibility of full maximum likelihood methods with big spatial datasets.",

    "abstract": "In prognostics and health management (PHM) of engineered systems, maintenance decisions are ideally informed by predictions of a system's remaining useful life (RUL) based on operational data. Model-based prognostics algorithms rely on a parametric model of the system degradation process. The model parameters are learned from real-time operational data collected on the system. However, there can be valuable information in data from similar systems or components, which is not typically utilized in PHM. In this contribution, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian modeling (HBM) framework for PHM that integrates both operational data and run-to-failure data from similar systems or components. The HBM framework utilizes hyperparameter distributions learned from data of similar systems or components as priors. It enables efficient updates of predictions as more information becomes available, allowing for increasingly accurate assessments of the degradation process and its associated variability. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through two experimental applications involving real-world data from crack growth and lithium battery degradation. Results show significant improvements in RUL prediction accuracy and demonstrate how the framework facilitates uncertainty management through predictive distributions.",

    "abstract": "Functional graphical models have undergone extensive development during the recent years, leading to a variety models such as the functional Gaussian graphical model, the functional copula Gaussian graphical model, the functional Bayesian graphical model, the nonparametric functional additive graphical model, and the conditional functional graphical model. These models rely either on some parametric form of distributions on random functions, or on additive conditional independence, a criterion that is different from probabilistic conditional independence. In this paper we introduce a nonparametric functional graphical model based on functional sufficient dimension reduction. Our method not only relaxes the Gaussian or copula Gaussian assumptions, but also enhances estimation accuracy by avoiding the ``curse of dimensionality''. Moreover, it retains the probabilistic conditional independence as the criterion to determine the absence of edges. By doing simulation study and analysis of the f-MRI dataset, we demonstrate the advantages of our method.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) data play a crucial role in the study of protein mutations, with contact prediction being a notable application. Existing methods are often model-based or algorithmic and typically do not incorporate statistical inference to quantify the uncertainty of the prediction outcomes. To address this, we propose a novel framework that transforms the task of contact prediction into a statistical testing problem. Our approach is motivated by the partial correlation for continuous random variables. With one-hot encoding of MSA data, we are able to construct a partial correlation graph for multivariate categorical variables. In this framework, two connected nodes in the graph indicate that the corresponding positions on the protein form a contact. A new spectrum-based test statistic is introduced to test whether two positions are partially correlated. Moreover, the new framework enables the identification of amino acid combinations that contribute to the correlation within the identified contacts, an important but largely unexplored aspect of protein mutations. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed method is valid in terms of controlling Type I errors and powerful in general. Real data applications on various protein families further validate the practical utility of our approach in coevolution and mutation analysis.",

    "abstract": "Macroeconomic conditions influence the environments in which health systems operate, yet their value as leading signals of health system capacity has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, we examine whether selected macroeconomic indicators contain predictive information for several capacity-related public health targets, including employment in the health and social assistance workforce, new business applications in the sector, and health care construction spending. Using monthly U.S. time series data, we evaluate multiple forecasting approaches, including neural network models with different optimization strategies, generalized additive models, random forests, and time series models with exogenous macroeconomic indicators, under alternative model fitting designs. Across evaluation settings, we find that macroeconomic indicators provide a consistent and reproducible predictive signal for some public health targets, particularly workforce and infrastructure measures, while other targets exhibit weaker or less stable predictability. Models emphasizing stability and implicit regularization tend to perform more reliably during periods of economic volatility. These findings suggest that macroeconomic indicators may serve as useful upstream signals for digital public health monitoring, while underscoring the need for careful model selection and validation when translating economic trends into health system forecasting tools.",

    "abstract": "Current alignment-based methods for classification in geometric morphometrics do not generally address the classification of new individuals that were not part of the study sample. However, in the context of infant and child nutritional assessment from body shape images this is a relevant problem. In this setting, classification rules obtained on the shape space from a reference sample cannot be used on out-of-sample individuals in a straightforward way. Indeed, a series of sample dependent processing steps, such as alignment (Procrustes analysis, for instance) or allometric regression, need to be conducted before the classification rule can be applied. This work proposes ways of obtaining shape coordinates for a new individual and analyzes the effect of using different template configurations on the sample of study as target for registration of the out-of-sample raw coordinates. Understanding sample characteristics and collinearity among shape variables is crucial for optimal classification results when evaluating children's nutritional status using arm shape analysis from photos.

    "abstract": "Weighting methods are essential tools for estimating causal effects in observational studies, with the goal of balancing pre-treatment covariates across treatment groups. Traditional approaches pursue this objective indirectly, for example, via inverse propensity score weighting or by matching a finite number of covariate moments, and therefore do not guarantee balance of the full joint covariate distributions. Recently, distributional balancing methods have emerged as robust, nonparametric alternatives that directly target alignment of entire covariate distributions, but they lack a unified framework, formal theoretical guarantees, and valid inferential procedures. We introduce a unified framework for nonparametric distributional balancing based on the characteristic function distance (CFD) and show that widely used discrepancy measures, including the maximum mean discrepancy and energy distance, arise as special cases. Our theoretical analysis establishes conditions under which the resulting CFD-based weighting estimator achieves $\\sqrt{n}$-consistency. Since the standard bootstrap may fail for this estimator, we propose subsampling as a valid alternative for inference. We further extend our approach to an instrumental variable setting to address potential unmeasured confounding. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our method through simulation studies and a real-world application, where the proposed estimator performs well and exhibits results consistent with our theoretical predictions.",

However, prior-dependence makes it important to assess the influence of plausible alternative priors. Such prior sensitivity analyses for the Bayesian evidence are expensive, either requiring repeated, costly model re-fits or specialised sampling schemes. By exploiting the learned harmonic mean estimator (LHME) for evidence calculation we decouple sampling and evidence calculation, allowing resampled posterior draws to be used directly to calculate the evidence without further likelihood evaluations. This provides an alternative approach to prior sensitivity analysis for Bayesian model comparison that dramatically alleviates the computational cost and is agnostic to the method used to generate posterior samples. We validate our method on toy problems and a cosmological case study, reproducing estimates obtained by full Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and nested sampling re-fits. For the cosmological example considered our approach achieves up to $6000\\times$ lower computational cost.",

Their sequence specificity is commonly summarized by a consensus binding motif. However, eukaryotic genomes contain billions of low-affinity DNA sequences to which TFs associate with a sequence-dependent binding energy. We currently lack insight into how the genomic sequence defines this spectrum of binding energies and the resulting pattern of TF localization. Here, we set out to obtain a quantitative understanding of sequence-dependent TF binding to both motif and non-motif sequences. We achieve this by first pursuing accurate measurements of physical binding energies of the human TF Klf4 to a library of short DNA sequences in a fluorescence-anisotropy-based bulk competitive binding assay. Second, we show that the highly non-linear sequence dependence of Klf4 binding energies can be captured by combining a linear model of binding energies with an Ising model of the coupled recognition of nucleotides by a TF. We find that this statistical mechanics model parametrized by our in vitro measurements captures Klf4 binding patterns on individual long DNA molecules stretched in the optical tweezer, and is predictive for Klf4 occupancy across the entire human genome without additional fit parameters.",

Simultaneously, new imaging techniques such as quantitative phase imaging (QPI) are being developed to capture richer cell information with less sample preparation. So far, the two worlds of WSI and QPI have not been combined. In this work, we present a reconstruction algorithm which makes whole slide imaging of cervical smears possible by using a self-referencing three-wave digital holographic microscope. Since a WSI is constructed by combining multiple patches, the algorithm is adaptive and can be used on partial holograms and patched holograms. We present the algorithm for a single shot hologram, the adaptations to make it flexible to various inputs and show that the algorithm performs well for the tested epithelial cells.

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages (phages) are key regulators of bacterial populations and hold great promise for applications such as phage therapy, biocontrol, and industrial fermentation. The success of these applications depends on accurately determining phage host range, which is often specific at the strain level rather than the species level. However, existing computational approaches face major limitations: many rely on genus-specific features that do not generalize across taxa, while others require large amounts of training data that are unavailable for most bacterial lineages. These challenges create a critical need for methods that can accurately predict strain-level phage-host interactions across diverse bacterial genera, particularly under data-limited conditions. We present PhageMind, a learning framework designed to address this challenge by enabling efficient transfer of knowledge across bacterial genera. PhageMind is trained to identify shared principles of phage-bacterium interactions from well-studied systems and to rapidly adapt these principles to new genera using only a small number of known interactions. To reflect the biological basis of infection, we represent phage-host relationships using a knowledge graph that explicitly incorporates phage tail fiber proteins and bacterial O-antigen biosynthesis gene clusters, and we use this representation to guide interaction prediction. Across four bacterial genera (Escherichia, Klebsiella, Vibrio, and Alteromonas), PhageMind achieves high prediction accuracy and shows strong adaptability to new lineages. In particular, in leave-one-genus-out evaluations, the model maintains robust performance when only limited reference data are available, demonstrating its potential as a scalable and practical tool for studying phage-host interactions across the global phageome.",

    "abstract": "Physics relies on mathematical spaces carefully matched to the phenomena under study. Phase space in classical mechanics, Hilbert space in quantum theory, configuration spaces in field theory all provide representations in which physical laws, stability and invariants become expressible and testable. In contrast, biology lacks an agreed-upon notion of space capturing context dependence, partial observability, degeneracy and irreversible dynamics. To address this gap, we introduce a unified mathematical space tailored to biological processes where states are represented in locally convex spaces indexed by context, where context includes both environment and history. Within our setting, proximity is defined through families of seminorms rather than a single global metric, allowing biological relevance to vary across conditions. Admissible sets encode biological constraints, observation maps formalize partial observability and many-to-one relations between state and dynamics capture irreversibility without requiring convergence to fixed points. Stabilization is characterized by neighborhood inclusion and degeneracy arises naturally through quotient structures induced by observation. We develop explicit constructions, operators and bounds within this space, yielding quantitative predictions dictated by its structure. A worked example based on EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer shows how single-cell data can be mapped into our framework, how numerical thresholds can be calibrated from the literature and how testable predictions can be formulated concerning rare tolerant states, context-dependent proximity and early stabilization. Overall, by providing biology with a space playing a role analogous to those used in physics, we aim to support structurally grounded and quantitative analyses of biological systems across contexts.",

    "abstract": "Volitional memory control supports adaptive cognition by enabling intentional Recall of goal-relevant information and Suppression of unwanted memories. While neural mechanisms underlying Recall and Suppression have been studied largely in isolation, less is known about the large-scale brain networks supporting these processes under competing cognitive demands, particularly as a function of subclinical anxiety. Here, we examined control of emotionally valenced memories during directed Recall and Suppression while 47 participants concurrently performed an independent visual working memory task. Cognitive control efficiency was quantified using the Balanced Integration Score (BIS), and seed-to-voxel resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) was used to characterize intrinsic network organization. Dissociable rsFC profiles were associated with memory control efficiency across emotional valences and were selectively moderated by anxiety. More efficient Suppression of positive memories was linked to reduced connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex and posterior perceptual-midline regions, as well as diminished hippocampal-frontal pole coupling. In contrast, efficient Suppression of negative memories was associated with increased connectivity between posterior parietal and lateral occipital regions. Anxiety moderated relationships between cognitive efficiency and prefrontal connectivity during Suppression of positive memories and Recall of positive and neutral memories. Direct comparisons further revealed stronger hippocampal-thalamic rsFC during Suppression relative to Recall of positive memories. Together, these findings delineate the functional brain architecture supporting volitional control of emotional memories under cognitive load and demonstrate that anxiety severity selectively shapes these network-level mechanisms across the anxiety continuum.",

    "abstract": "This study presents the first large-scale empirical evaluation of quantum machine learning for predicting antibiotic resistance in clinical urine cultures. Antibiotic resistance is amongst the top threats to humanity, and inappropriate antibiotic use is a main driver of resistance. We developed a Quantum Projective Learning (QPL) approach and executed 60 qubit experiments on IBM Eagle and Heron quantum processing units. While QPL did not consistently outperform classical baselines, potentially reflecting current quantum hardware limitations, it did achieve parity or superiority in specific scenarios, notably for the antibiotic nitrofurantoin and selected data splits, revealing that quantum advantage may be data-dependent. Analysis of data complexity measures uncovered a multivariate signature, which comprised Shannon entropy, Fisher Discriminant Ratio, standard deviation of kurtosis, number of low-variance features, and total correlations. The multivariate model accurately (AUC = 0.88, $p$-value = 0.03) distinguished cases wherein QPL executed on quantum hardware would outperform classical models. This signature suggests that quantum kernels excel in feature spaces with high entropy and structural complexity. These findings point to complexity-driven adaptive model selection as a promising strategy for optimizing hybrid quantum-classical workflows in healthcare. Overall, this investigation marks the first application of quantum machine learning in urology, and in antibiotic resistance prediction. Further, this work highlights conditional quantum utility and introduces a principled approach for leveraging data complexity signatures to guide quantum machine learning deployment in biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "The fundamental understanding of how cells physically interact with each other and their environment is key to understanding their organisation in living tissues. Over the past decades several computational methods have been developed to decipher emergent multi-cellular behaviors. In particular agent-based (or cell-based) models that consider the individual cell as basic modeling unit tracked in space and time enjoy increasing interest across scientific communities. In this article we explore a particular class of cell-based models, so-called Deformable Cell Models (DCMs), that allow to simulate the biophysics of the cell with high realism. After situating this model among other model types, We give an overview of past and recent DCM developments and discuss new simulation results of several applications covering in-vitro and in-vivo systems. Our goal is to demonstrate how such models can generate quantitative added value in biological and biotechnological problems.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the population dynamics of ecological systems is crucial for predicting shifts in biodiversity and ensuring the protection of these systems. Established models often focus on pairwise species interactions, yet recent studies have highlighted the importance of higher-order interactions (HOIs) in shaping community structure and function. In this study, we investigate the effects of HOIs in an agent-based model with three species engaged in intransitive competition. We introduce an HOI where one species modifies the competition between the other two. We explore the impact of the strength, radius of influence, and speed of this interaction modification on species abundances and oscillations thereof. Our results show that these abundances are not only greatly impacted by the strength, but also by the radius and speed of the interaction modification. A deeper investigation demonstrates that the changes in the oscillations are caused by the interaction modification itself, and not the change in pairwise interaction strength caused by the HOI. These results emphasize the importance of considering the spatio-temporal scales of higher-order interactions when assessing ecosystem stability, highlighting that such interactions can introduce complex dynamical behaviors that go beyond the predictions of traditional pairwise or simpler higher-order models",

    "abstract": "Ensuring safety for autonomous systems under uncertainty remains challenging, particularly when safety of the true state is required despite the true state not being fully known. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have become widely adopted as safety filters. However, standard CBF formulations do not explicitly account for state estimation uncertainty and its propagation, especially for stochastic systems evolving on manifolds. In this paper, we propose a safety-critical control framework with a provable bound on the finite-time safety probability for stochastic systems under noisy state information. The proposed framework explicitly incorporates the uncertainty arising from both process and measurement noise, and synthesizes controllers that adapt to the level of uncertainty. The framework admits closed-form solutions in linear settings, and experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness on systems whose state spaces range from Euclidean space to Lie groups.",

Thus, spatial and spectral information can be jointly exploited, while at the same time allowing for speakers speaking from different positions. Experiments on the LibriCSS data set with simulated speaker position changes show great improvements over tightly coupled subsystems.",

The decoding is performed using the traditional multipath matching pursuit algorithm, and the overall complexity is significantly reduced by exploiting the sparsity of the codebook.

    "abstract": "Graph topology identification (GTI) is a central challenge in networked systems, where the underlying structure is often hidden, yet nodal data are available. Conventional solutions to address these challenges rely on probabilistic models or complex optimization formulations, commonly suffering from non-convexity or requiring restrictive assumptions on acyclicity or positivity. In this paper, we propose a novel covariance matching (CovMatch) framework that directly aligns the empirical covariance of the observed data with the theoretical covariance implied by an underlying graph. We show that as long as the data-generating process permits an explicit covariance expression, CovMatch offers a unified route to topology inference.   We showcase our methodology on linear structural equation models (SEMs), showing that CovMatch naturally handles both undirected and general sparse directed graphs - whether acyclic or positively weighted - without explicit knowledge of these structural constraints. Through appropriate reparameterizations, CovMatch simplifies the graph learning problem to either a conic mixed integer program for undirected graphs or an orthogonal matrix optimization for directed graphs. Numerical results confirm that, even for relatively large graphs, our approach efficiently recovers the true topology and outperforms standard baselines in accuracy. These findings highlight CovMatch as a powerful alternative to log-determinant or Bayesian methods for GTI, paving the way for broader research on learning complex network topologies with minimal assumptions.",

To investigate the propagation effects and small-scale fading differences between mmWave and conventional centimeter wave (cmWave) bands, multi-band channel measurements have to be conducted. One key parameter to characterize small-scale fading is the Rician K-factor. In this paper, we analyze the time-varying K-factor of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) channels across multiple frequency bands, measured in an urban street environment. Specifically, we investigate three frequency bands with center frequencies of 3.2 GHz, 34.3 GHz and 62.35 GHz using measurement data with 155.5 MHz bandwidth and a sounding repetition rate of 31.25 μs. Furthermore, we analyze the relationship between K-factor and root-mean-square (RMS) delay spread. We show that the Ricean K-factor is similar at different frequency bands and that is correlated with the RMS delay spread.",

    "abstract": "Future wireless communications will rely on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) beamforming operating at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands to deliver high data rates. To support flexible spatial processing and meet the demands of latency critical applications, it is essential to use fully digital mmWave MIMO beamforming, which relies on accurate channel estimation. However, ensuring power efficiency in fully digital mmWave MIMO systems requires the use of low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The reduced resolution of these quantizers introduces distortion in both transmitted and received signals, ultimately degrading system performance. In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation performance of mmWave MIMO systems employing fully digital beamforming with low-resolution quantization, under practical system constraints. We evaluate the system performance in terms of spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE). Simulation results demonstrate that a moderate quantization resolutions of 4-bit per DAC/ADC offers a favorable trade-off between energy consumption and achievable data rate.",

    "abstract": "In passive radar, a network of distributed sensors exploit signals from so-called Illuminators-of-Opportunity to detect and localize targets. We consider the case where the IO signal is available at each receiver node through a reference channel, whereas target returns corrupted by interference are collected in a separate surveillance channel. The problem formulation is similar to an active radar that uses a noise-like waveform, or an integrated sensing and communication application. The available data is first split into batches of manageable size. In the direct approach, the target's time-delay and Doppler parameters are estimated jointly by incoherently combining the batch-wise data. We propose a new method to estimate the time-delay separately, thus avoiding a costly 2-D search. Our approach is designed for slowly moving targets, and the accuracy of the time-delay estimate is similar to that of the full batch-wise 2-D method. Given the time-delay, the coherency between batches can be restored when estimating the Doppler parameter. Thereby, the separable approach is found to yield superior Doppler estimates over a wide parameter range. In addition to reducing computational complexity, the proposed separable estimation technique also significantly reduces the communication overhead in a distributed radar setting.",

In this paper, a dual-mapping SVC (DM-SVC) based short packet transmission scheme is proposed to further enhance the transmission performance of SVC. The core idea behind the proposed scheme lies in mapping the transmitted information bits onto sparse vectors via block and single-element sparse mappings. The block sparse mapping pattern is able to concentrate the transmit power in a small number of non-zero blocks thus improving the decoding accuracy, while the single-element sparse mapping pattern ensures that the code length does not increase dramatically with the number of transmitted information bits. At the receiver, a two-stage decoding algorithm is proposed to sequentially identify non-zero block indexes and single-element non-zero indexes. Extensive simulation results verify that proposed DM-SVC scheme outperforms the existing SVC schemes in terms of block error rate and spectral efficiency.",

    "abstract": "We propose an adaptive non-uniform sampling framework for bandlimited signals based on an algorithm-encoder co-design perspective. By revisiting the convergence analysis of iterative reconstruction algorithms for non-uniform measurements, we derive a local, energy-based sufficient condition that governs reconstruction behavior as a function of the signal and derivative energies within each sampling interval. Unlike classical approaches that impose a global Nyquist-type bound on the inter-sample spacing, the proposed condition permits large gaps in slowly varying regions while enforcing denser sampling only where the signal exhibits rapid temporal variation. Building on this theoretical insight, we design a variable-bias, variable-threshold integrate-and-fire time encoding machine (VBT-IF-TEM) whose firing mechanism is explicitly shaped to enforce the derived local convergence condition. To ensure robustness, a shifted-signal formulation is introduced to suppress excessive firing in regions where the magnitude of the signal amplitude is close to zero or the local signal energy approaches zero. Using the proposed encoder, an analog signal is discretely represented by time encodings and signal averages, enabling perfect reconstruction via a standard iterative algorithm even when the local sampling rate falls below the Nyquist rate. Simulation results on synthetic signals and experiments on ultrasonic guided-wave and ECG signals demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves substantial reductions in sampling density compared to uniform sampling and conventional IF-TEMs, while maintaining accurate reconstruction. The results further highlight a controllable tradeoff between sampling density, reconstruction accuracy, and convergence behavior, which can be navigated through adaptive parameter selection.",

Typical communication signals comprise both deterministic known pilot signals and random unknown data payloads. Most existing approaches either rely solely on pilots for positioning, thereby ignoring the radar information present in the received data symbols that constitute the majority of each frame, or rely on data decisions, which bounds positioning performance to that of the communication system. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method that extracts positioning information from data payloads without decoding them. We consider an opportunistic scenario in which communication signals from a user are captured by an opportunistic radar equipped with a Uniform Linear Arrays of antennas. We show that, in this setting, the estimation can be efficiently implemented using Fast Fourier Transforms.

Conventional DMCANC methods, however, typically assume synchronous communication and require frequent data exchange, resulting in high communication overhead. To enhance efficiency and adaptability, this work proposes an asynchronous communication strategy where each node executes a weight-constrained filtered-x LMS (WCFxLMS) algorithm and independently requests communication only when its local noise reduction performance degrades. Upon request, other nodes transmit the weight difference between their local control filter and the center point in WCFxLMS, which are then integrated to update both the control filter and the center point. This design enables nodes to operate asynchronously while preserving cooperative behavior. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed asynchronous communication DMCANC (ACDMCANC) system maintains effective noise reduction with significantly reduced communication load, offering improved scalability for heterogeneous networks.",

The system's primary objective is to levitate a steel ball using electromagnetic force without physical contact, thereby eliminating frictional losses. A comprehensive state-space model was developed, capturing both the mechanical and electrical dynamics. The equilibrium points of the system were determined through feedback linearization using the Jacobian matrix. To ensure system stability, controllability and observability analyses were conducted, confirming that state feedback and observer-based control strategies could be effectively implemented. Three distinct control methods were explored: pole placement-based state feedback control, full-order observer design, and optimal state feedback control using the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). Each control strategy was validated through Simulink simulations for both linearized and nonlinear models. Simulation results demonstrated that the linearized system consistently achieved desired performance with minimal oscillations, whereas the nonlinear system exhibited significant transient oscillations before stabilization. The full-order observer enhanced estimation accuracy, enabling effective control where direct state measurement was impractical. The LQR-based control offered improved robustness and minimized control effort, though its performance was comparable to standard state feedback in some cases.",

    "title": "Amalgamated CHIRP and OFDM for ISAC",
    "abstract": "Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) requires the development of a waveform capable of efficiently supporting both communication and sensing functionalities. This paper proposes a novel waveform that combines the benefits of both the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and the chirp waveforms to improve both the communication and sensing performance within an ISAC framework. Hence, a new architecture is proposed that utilizes the conventional communication framework while leveraging the parameters sensed at the receiver (Rx) for enhancing the communication performance. We demonstrate that the affine addition of OFDM and chirp signals results in a near constant-envelope OFDM waveform, which effectively reduces the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), a key limitation of traditional OFDM systems. Using the OFDM framework for sensing in the conventional fashion requires the allocation of some resources for sensing, which in turn reduces communication performance. As a remedy, the proposed affine amalgam facilitates sensing through the chirp waveform without consuming communication resources, thereby preserving communication efficiency. Furthermore, a novel technique of integrating the chirp signal into the OFDM framework at the slot-level is proposed to enhance the accuracy of range estimation. The results show that the OFDM signal incorporated with chirp has better autocorrelation properties, improved root mean square error (RMSE) of range and velocity, and lower PAPR. Finally, we characterize the trade-off between communications and sensing performance.",

Parallel FIR filtering enhances computational efficiency and throughput in digital signal processing (DSP) applications by enabling the simultaneous processing of multiple input samples. We revisit a prior approach to design of fast parallel filter architectures by using the iterated FFA approach where the same primitive filter, such as 2-parallel, is iterated to design the fast parallel filter. In this paper, we present yet another novel iterated fast parallel FIR filter, referred to as the fast hybrid filter. The hybrid filter iterates a transposed 2-parallel fast FIR filter in all the inner layers and a direct-form 2-parallel fast FIR filter in the outermost layer, resulting in reduced hardware complexity. Such an iterated hybrid approach has not been presented before. We show that the hybrid fast parallel filters require less number of additions compared to prior approaches.",

    "abstract": "Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations have become vital in emerging commercial and defense Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs). However, their predictable orbital dynamics and exposed geometries make them highly susceptible to ground-based jamming. Traditional single-satellite interference mitigation techniques struggle to spatially separate desired uplink signals from nearby jammers, even with large antenna arrays. This paper explores a distributed multi-satellite anti-jamming strategy leveraging the dense connectivity and high-speed inter-satellite links of modern LEO mega-constellations. We model the uplink interference scenario as a convex-concave game between a desired terrestrial transmitter and a jammer, each optimizing their spatial covariance matrices to maximize or minimize achievable rate. We propose an efficient min-max solver combining alternating best-response updates with projected gradient descent, achieving fast convergence of the beamforming strategy to the Nash equilibrium. Using realistic Starlink orbital geometries and Sionna ray-tracing simulations, we demonstrate that while close-proximity jammers can cripple single-satellite links, distributed satellite cooperation significantly enhances resilience, shifting the capacity distribution upward under strong interference.",

    "abstract": "Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) convert high-speed waveform data into low-speed phasor data, which are fundamental to wide-area monitoring and control in power systems, with oscillation detection and localization among their most prominent applications. However, representing electrical waveform signals with oscillations using PMU phasors is effective only for low-frequency oscillations. This paper investigates the root causes of this limitation, focusing on errors introduced by Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based signal processing, in addition to the attenuation effects of anti-aliasing filters, and the impact of low reporting rates. To better represent and estimate waveform signals with oscillations, we propose a more general signal model and a multi-step estimation method that leverages one-cycle DFT, the Matrix Pencil Method, and the Least Squares Method. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed signal model and estimation method. Furthermore, this paper reveals that the phasor concept, let alone PMU phasors, can become invalid for waveform signals with high-frequency oscillations characterized by asymmetric sub- and super-synchronous components. These findings highlight the fundamental limitations of PMU data and phasor concept, and emphasize the need to rely on waveform data for analyzing high-frequency oscillations in modern power systems.",

    "title": "Semantics in Actuation Systems: From Age of Actuation to Age of Actuated Information",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the timeliness of actions in communication systems where actuation is constrained by control permissions or energy availability. Building on the Age of Actuation (AoA) metric, which quantifies the timeliness of actions independently of data freshness, we introduce a new metric, the \\emph{Age of Actuated Information (AoAI)}. AoAI captures the end-to-end timeliness of actions by explicitly accounting for the age of the data packet at the moment it is actuated. We analyze and characterize both AoA and AoAI in discrete-time systems with data storage capabilities under multiple actuation scenarios. The actuator requires both a data packet and an actuation opportunity, which may be provided by a controller or enabled by harvested energy. Data packets may be stored either in a single-packet buffer or an infinite-capacity queue for future actuation. For these settings, we derive closed-form expressions for the average AoA and AoAI and investigate their structural differences. While AoA and AoAI coincide in instantaneous actuation systems, they differentiate when data buffering is present. Our results reveal counterintuitive regimes in which increasing update or actuation rates degrade action timeliness for both AoA and AoAI. Moreover, as part of the analysis, we obtain a novel closed-form characterization of the steady-state distribution of a Geo/Geo/1 queue operating under the FCFS discipline, expressed solely in terms of the queue length and the age of the head-of-line packet. The proposed metrics and analytical results provide new insights into the semantics of timeliness in systems where information ultimately serves the purpose of actuation.",

    "abstract": "The integration of electromagnetic metasurfaces into wireless communications enables intelligent control of the propagation environment. Recently, flexible intelligent metasurfaces (FIMs) have evolved beyond conventional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), enabling three-dimensional surface deformation for adaptive wave manipulation. However, most existing FIM-aided system designs assume perfect instantaneous channel state information (CSI), which is impractical in large-scale networks due to the high training overhead and complicated channel estimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a robust statistical-CSI-based optimization framework for downlink multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems with FIM-assisted transmitters. A block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based iterative algorithm is developed to jointly optimize power allocation and FIM morphing, maximizing the average achievable sum rate. Simulation results show that the proposed statistical-CSI-driven FIM design significantly outperforms conventional rigid antenna arrays (RAAs), validating its effectiveness and practicality.",

    "abstract": "Developing algorithms for sound classification, detection, and localization requires large amounts of flexible and realistic audio data, especially when leveraging modern machine learning and beamforming techniques. However, most existing acoustic simulators are tailored for indoor environments and are limited to static sound sources, making them unsuitable for scenarios involving moving sources, moving microphones, or long-distance propagation. This paper presents DynamicSound an open-source acoustic simulation framework for generating multichannel audio from one or more sound sources with the possibility to move them continuously in three-dimensional space and recorded by arbitrarily configured microphone arrays. The proposed model explicitly accounts for finite sound propagation delays, Doppler effects, distance-dependent attenuation, air absorption, and first-order reflections from planar surfaces, yielding temporally consistent spatial audio signals. Unlike conventional mono or stereo simulators, the proposed system synthesizes audio for an arbitrary number of virtual microphones, accurately reproducing inter-microphone time delays, level differences, and spectral coloration induced by the environment. Comparative evaluations with existing open-source tools demonstrate that the generated signals preserve high spatial fidelity across varying source positions and acoustic conditions. By enabling the generation of realistic multichannel audio under controlled and repeatable conditions, the proposed open framework provides a flexible and reproducible tool for the development, training, and evaluation of modern spatial audio and sound-source localization algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Generative image inpainting can produce realistic, high-fidelity results even with large, irregular masks. However, existing methods still face key issues that make inpainted images look unnatural. In this paper, we identify two main problems: (1) Unwanted object insertion: generative models may hallucinate arbitrary objects in the masked region that do not match the surrounding context. (2) Color inconsistency: inpainted regions often exhibit noticeable color shifts, leading to smeared textures and degraded image quality. We analyze the underlying causes of these issues and propose efficient post-hoc solutions for pre-trained inpainting models. Specifically, we introduce the principled framework of Aligned Stable inpainting with UnKnown Areas prior (ASUKA). To reduce unwanted object insertion, we use reconstruction-based priors to guide the generative model, suppressing hallucinated objects while preserving generative flexibility. To address color inconsistency, we design a specialized VAE decoder that formulates latent-to-image decoding as a local harmonization task. This design significantly reduces color shifts and produces more color-consistent results. We implement ASUKA on two representative inpainting architectures: a U-Net-based model and a DiT-based model. We analyze and propose lightweight injection strategies that minimize interference with the model's original generation capacity while ensuring the mitigation of the two issues. We evaluate ASUKA using the Places2 dataset and MISATO, our proposed diverse benchmark. Experiments show that ASUKA effectively suppresses object hallucination and improves color consistency, outperforming standard diffusion, rectified flow models, and other inpainting methods.

In this paper, we introduce a Truncated Taylor Control Barrier Function (TTCBF), which generalizes standard discrete-time CBFs to consider high-order safety constraints and requires only one class K function, independent of the relative degree. We also propose an adaptive variant, adaptive TTCBF (aTTCBF), that optimizes an online gain on the class K function to improve adaptability, while requiring fewer control design parameters than existing adaptive HOCBF variants. Numerical experiments in a relative-degree-six spring-mass system and a cluttered corridor navigation validate the above theoretical findings.",

    "abstract": "One of the key features of sixth generation (6G) mobile communications will be integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). While the main goal of ISAC in standardization efforts is to detect objects, the byproducts of radar operations can be used to enable new services in 6G, such as weather sensing. Even though weather radars are the most prominent technology for weather detection and monitoring, they are expensive and usually neglect areas in close vicinity. To this end, we propose reusing the dense deployment of 6G base stations for weather sensing purposes by detecting and estimating weather conditions. We implement both a classifier and a regressor as a convolutional neural network trained across measurements with varying precipitation rates and wind speeds. We implement our approach in an ISAC proof-of-concept, and conduct a multi-week experiment campaign. Experimental results show that we are able to jointly and accurately classify weather conditions with accuracies of 99.38% and 98.99% for precipitation rate and wind speed, respectively. For estimation, we obtain errors of 1.2 mm/h and 1.5 km/h, for precipitation rate and wind speed, respectively. These findings indicate that weather sensing services can be reliably deployed in 6G ISAC networks, broadening their service portfolio and boosting their market value.",

The system in consideration follows primary energy technologies in Thailand including solar power, battery storage, and a diverse portfolio of renewable and carbon-based energy procurement sources. Unlike existing literature focused on long-term planning, this study addresses near real-time operations using a 15-minute resolution. A novel feature of the formulation is the explicit treatment of CFE compliance as a model parameter, enabling flexible targets such as a minimum percentage of hourly matching or a required number of carbon-free days within a multi-day horizon. The mixed-integer linear programming formulation accounts for uncertainties in load and solar generation by integrating deep learning-based forecasting within a receding horizon framework. By optimizing battery profiles and multi-source procurement simultaneously, the proposed system provides a feasible pathway for transitioning to carbon-free operations in emerging energy markets.",

    "abstract": "This chapter focuses on active sensing using sparse arrays. In active sensing applications, such as radar, sonar, wireless communications, and medical ultrasound, a collection of sensors probes the environment by emitting self-generated energy. A key benefit of such active multi-sensor arrays is their ability to focus and steer energy in desired directions by beamforming on transmit. Sparse sensor arrays offer several advantages over conventional uniform arrays, including improved resolution using fewer physical sensors and the capability to identify more scatterers than sensors. This is facilitated by the effective transmit-receive virtual array known as the sum co-array, which can have many more virtual sensors than the number of physical transmit or receive sensors. Herein, we focus on the design of low-redundancy sparse array configurations and on employing transmit-receive (Tx-Rx) beamforming using sparse arrays. We discuss the optimal, but computationally intractable Minimum-redundancy array, and a scalable symmetric array framework, which extends many well-known passive sparse array geometries to the active case. We also examine mitigating side lobes arising from spatial undersampling by a synthetic beamforming method known as image addition. We briefly present approaches for finding the physical beamforming weights synthesizing a desired Tx-Rx beampattern, and consider related spatio-temporal trade-offs. We conclude by discussing selected applications of sparse arrays in active sensing.",

    "abstract": "The impact of rising consumption on wealth inequality remains an open question. Here we revisit and extend the Social Architecture of Capitalism agent-based model proposed by Ian Wright, which reproduces stylized facts of wealth and income distributions. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the macroscopic behavior of the model is predominantly governed by a single dimensionless parameter, the ratio between average wealth per capita and mean salary, denoted by R. The shape of the wealth distribution, the emergence of a two-class structure, and the level of inequality -- summarized by the Gini index -- were found to depend mainly on R, with inequality increasing as R increases. In the present work, we examine the robustness of this result by relaxing some simplifying assumptions of the model. We first allow transactions such as purchases, salary payments, and revenue collections to occur with different frequencies, reflecting the heterogeneous temporal dynamics of real economies. We then impose limits on the maximum fractions of wealth that agents can spend or collect at each step, constraining the amplitude of individual transactions. We find that the dependence of the inequality on R remains qualitatively robust, although the detailed distribution patterns are affected by relative frequencies and transaction limits. Finally, we analyze a further variant of the model with adaptive wages emerging endogenously from the dynamics, showing that self-organized labor-market feedback can either stabilize or amplify inequality depending on macroeconomic conditions.",

We develop a model with endogenous entry and heterogeneous project quality in which OSS is a scalable input into producing more software. Users choose whether to use OSS directly or through vibe coding. Vibe coding raises productivity by lowering the cost of using and building on existing code, but it also weakens the user engagement through which many maintainers earn returns. When OSS is monetized only through direct user engagement, greater adoption of vibe coding lowers entry and sharing, reduces the availability and quality of OSS, and reduces welfare despite higher productivity. Sustaining OSS at its current scale under widespread vibe coding requires major changes in how maintainers are paid.",

In line with recent results showing that dynamics on one phase space surface can outperform dynamics on one Born-Oppenheimer surface, our results indicate that the same advantages should largely hold for curve crossings and dynamics on two or a handful of electronic surfaces, from which several implications can be surmised as far as the possibility of spin-dependent electron transfer dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Fluctuations are an intrinsic feature of many-body systems, and their full statistical distributions reveal a wealth of information about the underlying physics. Of particular interest are non-Gaussian, extreme-value statistics that arise when nontrivial correlations and criticality dominate over the central limit theorem. Strikingly, in two-dimensional (2D) quantum fluids, such effects have been predicted to manifest in the order parameter distribution in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) superfluid phase, which approaches a universal extreme-value form in the low-temperature limit. Here, we measure the order parameter statistics of 2D Bose gases across the BKT critical point using matter-wave interferometry. This allows us to confirm the predicted convergence of the observed statistics to a universal Gumbel distribution at low temperatures, to the 0.1% level of the probability density. Furthermore, the intrinsic precision of the atom interferometer allows the robust extraction of higher-moment observables such as skewness and kurtosis; in particular, we report direct measurements of the Binder cumulant which allows us to precisely identify the onset of the phase transition. Extending this approach to the investigation of non-equilibrium systems, we probe vortex unbinding dynamics following a quench across the BKT critical point and identify parameter-independent scaling behaviour of higher moments.",

    "abstract": "Political moderation, a key attractor in democratic systems, proves highly fragile under realistic information conditions. We develop a stochastic model of opinion dynamics to analyze how noise and differential susceptibility reshape the political spectrum. Extending Marvel et al.'s deterministic framework, we incorporate stochastic media influence $ζ(t)$ and neuropolitically-grounded sensitivity differences ($σ_y > σ_x$). Analysis reveals the moderate population -- stable in deterministic models -- undergoes catastrophic collapse under stochastic forcing. This occurs through an effective deradicalization asymmetry ($u_{B}^{\\text{eff}} = u + σ_y^2/2 > u_{A}^{\\text{eff}}$) that drives conservatives to extinction, eliminating cross-cutting interactions that sustain moderates. The system exhibits a phase transition from multi-stable coexistence to liberal dominance, demonstrating how information flow architecture -- independent of content -- systematically dismantles the political center. Our findings reveal moderation as an emergent property highly vulnerable to stochastic perturbations in complex social systems.",

    "abstract": "Seismic wave forward and inverse modeling are fundamental tools for subsurface imaging and geological hazard assessment. Conventional grid-based numerical methods, such as finite-difference and finite-element approaches, often require dense discretization and repeated forward simulations, leading to high computational cost in inverse problems. Although deep learning has shown promise in seismic applications, its performance is commonly limited by the need for large labeled datasets and weak enforcement of physical constraints.   In this study, we propose a unified physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for forward modeling and parameter inversion of viscoacoustic wave propagation. By embedding the viscoacoustic wave equation into the learning process, the proposed framework accurately reproduces wavefields, attenuation, and phase characteristics, while enabling the simultaneous inversion of velocity and attenuation parameters from temporally sparse observations.   Numerical experiments demonstrate that the PINN approach achieves stable and reliable accuracy compared with finite-difference solutions, while exhibiting reduced sensitivity to spatial discretization. These results highlight the potential of PINNs as a data-efficient and physically consistent alternative for high-resolution seismic modeling and inversion in attenuative media.",

The direct study of the gain-layer is not possible with typical defect spectroscopy measurements like Thermally Stimulated Currents (TSC) and Deep-Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS). To combat this problem and gain a better understanding of the processes which degrade LGADs, the Gain-Layer Project was started.   This project produced 19050 diodes with various Boron, Phosphorus, Oxygen and Carbon concentrations. The material used is low-resistivity p-type Silicon. The effective doping concentrations are in the order of a LGAD gain-layer. These diodes will serve the defect community in the coming years for various studies.

ERBS automatically identifies collective variables by dimensionality reduction of atomic descriptors and applies a bias potential inspired by the On-the-Fly Probability Enhanced Sampling framework. We highlight the ability of Gaussian moment descriptors to capture collective molecular motions and explore the impact of biasing parameters using alanine dipeptide as a benchmark system. We show that free energy surfaces can be reconstructed with high fidelity using only short biased trajectories as training data. Further, we apply the method to the iterative construction of a liquid water dataset and compare the quality of simulated self-diffusion coefficients for models trained with molecular dynamics and ERBS data. Further, we active-learn models for liquid water with and without enhanced sampling and compare the quality of simulated self-diffusion coefficients. The self-diffusion coefficients closely match those simulated with a reference model at a significantly reduced dataset size. Finally, we compare the sampling behaviour of enhanced sampling methods by benchmarking the mean squared displacements of \\ce{BMIM+BF4-} trajectories simulated with uncertainty-driven dynamics and ERBS and find that the latter significantly increases the exploration of configurational space.",

This speed corresponds to the maximum mean flow velocity below which dissipation is absent. In the weak-obstacle regime, linear-response theory shows that the critical speed is set by Landau's criterion applied to the density and spin Bogoliubov modes, whose relative ordering can be inverted due to saturation of the optical nonlinearity. For obstacles of arbitrary strength and large spatial extent, we determine the critical speed from the conditions for strong ellipticity of the stationary hydrodynamic equations within the hydraulic and incompressible approximations. Numerical simulations in this regime reveal that the breakdown of superfluidity is initiated by the nucleation of vortex-antivortex pairs for an impenetrable obstacle, and of Jones-Roberts soliton-type structures for a penetrable obstacle. Beyond superfluids of light, our results provide a general framework for the critical speed of 2D binary nonlinear Schrödinger superflows, including Bose-Bose quantum mixtures.",

By utilizing orthogonal waveguide eigenmodes as independent information carriers, our architecture achieves robust single-wavelength computation that is inherently immune to spectral crosstalk and phase noise. The fabricated MOENN chip monolithically integrates all functional components, including input encoders, programmable mode-division fan-in/-out units, and most importantly, the nonlinear multimode activation functions. We report the system's versatility through in-situ training via a genetic algorithm, successfully resolving the nonlinear decision boundaries of a two-class dataset and achieving 92.1% accuracy on the Iris classification benchmark. Furthermore, we reconfigure the MOENN into a one-dimensional convolutional neural network, attaining an accuracy of 90.7% on the electrocardiogram-based emotion recognition task.

    "abstract": "Carbon monoxide (CO) is a significant indicator gas with considerable application value in atmospheric monitoring, industrial production and medical diagnosis. Its fundamental vibrational band locates around 4.6 $\\upmu$m and has larger absorption line strength than that of overtone band, which is more suitable for the precise identification and concentration detection of CO. In this paper, the up-conversion detection is employed to convert the mid-infrared absorption signal obtained by TDLAS to the visible light band, then a silicon-based detector is utilized for detection. By which, we can achieve the highest sensitivity of 79.6 ppb under the condition of cavity-free in-situ with an absorption range length of only 0.14 m. Furthermore, the single-photon level real-time detection of CO concentration after the diffuse reflection is realized by using SPAD. This work demonstrates the merits of the up-conversion detection in terms of its functionality at room temperature and capacity for sensitivity detection. Furthermore, it presents a design and optimization methodology that has the potential to underpin the advancement of the method towards more practical applications, like industrial process monitoring, medical diagnosis and so on.",

Direct determination of \\(k_s\\) typically requires detailed velocity and wall-shear stress measurements, which are often impractical. As an alternative, this study presents a data assimilation framework that modifies a smooth-wall Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) baseline to match sparse rough-wall particle image velocimetry (PIV) data in the fully rough regime. Through this approach, secondary variables such as the friction velocity, \\(u_τ\\), and \\(k_s\\) can be inferred from the assimilated flow fields. The assimilated TBL reproduces experimental velocity profiles within 1\\% and predicts friction velocity within 1-6\\% of the experimental measurements. Furthermore, the \\(k_s\\) values inferred from the assimilation also match the experimental data up to 1\\%.

    "abstract": "Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have emerged as the highest performing photon-counting detectors, making them a critical technology in quantum photonics and photon-starved optical sensing. However, the performance of SNSPDs is limited not by the intrinsic properties of the superconducting film, but by edge-induced current crowding. Despite extensive materials optimization and increasingly demanding fabrication strategies aimed at mitigating this edge-limited behavior, the device edges continue to limit the maximum device operating current, thereby degrading key performance metrics. Here, we demonstrate for the first time in situ tuning of a detector from an edge-limited to a bulk-limited regime, allowing the device to reach its intrinsic performance limit. Our approach is based on current-biased superconducting \"rails\" placed on either side of the detector to suppress current crowding at the edges. We show that activation of the rails reduces the dark count rate by nine orders of magnitude and extends the photon detection plateau at 1550 nm by more than 40%. These results are demonstrated on detectors up to 0.1 mm wide, establishing an entirely new class of ultra-wide strip detectors that we call superconducting strip photon detectors (SSPD). Moreover, the ability to suppress edge current crowding using the rails provides a pathway toward SSPDs with strip widths extending into the mm-scale. Such devices will enable large-area, high efficiency SSPD arrays with infrared sensitivity and open new opportunities in applications ranging from biomedical imaging to deep space optical communication.",

More precisely, for the investigated composition range of ternary mixtures, it is shown that a linear mixing rule applies for fluorescence lifetime with the proportion of the two PEG, and with an increasing ratio of heavy PEG leading to larger lifetimes. These results allow to test more precisely the free volume theory, which has been proposed in the context of probing glass transition.

    "abstract": "Partitioning large networks into stable clusters of synchronized nodes is a challenging task. Recent approaches based on spectral analysis can provide exact results on specific dynamics but remain unfeasible for very large networks. Moreover, within a stochastic framework, it is unclear which dynamics should be chosen to study synchronization. Here we propose an unbiased and scalable method based on the message-passing algorithm. By exploiting the collective behavior emerging across critical points of an effective Ising-like model, we identify dynamically coherent clusters of synchronized nodes and illustrate the approach on some large real-world networks. We find that, unlike continuous-time dynamics, abrupt desyncrhronization occurs even in simple graphs, without the need to invoke higher order interactions. However, when noise is included, the transition to synchronization becomes smoother and proceeds through the formation of plateaus, albeit at the cost of requiring larger coupling strengths.",

    "abstract": "Future liquid-xenon (LXe) based observatories for rare processes, such as XLZD, require testing of large components and sub-assemblies in cryogenic liquid or gaseous xenon environments. Here we present results from the stable operation of a shallow dual-phase LXe TPC with an inner diameter of 133.4\\,cm and a height of 3.1\\,cm in the unshielded PANCAKE platform, without underground suppression of cosmic-ray backgrounds. A total of 340\\,kg of xenon was used in the experiment, of which 127\\,kg constituted the active TPC mass. Measurements of the LXe purity-dependent electron lifetime and the electron drift velocity in LXe demonstrate that sensitive measurements to characterize the TPC performance are possible in a high-background environment, even with a very basic PMT-based light detection system. Improving this will straightforwardly reduce the TPC threshold, which was observed to be around 15\\,keV for electronic recoils in TPC operation.",

To address these challenges, the development of non-standard sensor designs and advanced fast readout electronics is required.

By modeling absorption image formation in logarithmic intensity space and applying deconvolution with an absorption optical transfer function, QAT enables quantitative, spectrally resolved 3D absorption imaging without interferometry, sample rotation, or specialized hardware. We validate QAT using spectrally selective phantoms and demonstrate absorption-specific contrast complementary to refractive index tomography in living melanocytes and intact plant tissue. QAT further scales to millimeter-scale volumes of H&E-stained human tissue, revealing 3D histological microarchitecture without serial sectioning.

    "abstract": "Perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are promising building blocks for quantum photonic devices. Optical properties of PNCs can be enhanced by integration with optical cavities or nanoantennas. Designing such structures requires accurate size dependent dielectric permittivity of PNCs. However, current reports provide primarily ensemble averaged values with limited access to the intrinsic response of individual PNCs. Here we suggest a methodology to reconstruct the size dependent complex dielectric permittivity of CsPbBr3 PNCs from the measured absorbance spectrum of colloidal solution. The permittivity of PNCs is modeled as a sum of Voigt profile oscillators, with the size dependent transition energies governed by the exciton effective mass. Using a transmission electron microscopy derived size distribution of the PNCs, the solution permittivity is obtained via Maxwell Garnett effective medium approximation. This permittivity is used in a transfer matrix method to simulate and fit the absorbance spectrum, from which the permittivity of PNCs is reconstructed. The extracted spectral linewidth from the imaginary part of the permittivity (78.4 meV) is consistent with single nanocrystal emission linewidths at room temperature. Finite element simulations show enhanced absorption cross section of a single PNC coupled to a nanoantenna, demonstrating applicability of the extracted permittivity. More generally, these findings provide a route to extract intrinsic permittivity of individual nanocrystals from absorbance measurements of their ensembles.",

    "abstract": "For LHC Run 3, the ALICE Time Projection Chamber was upgraded to operate in continuous readout mode. Interaction rates of up to 50 kHz in Pb-Pb collisions require real-time processing of more than 3 TB/s of raw detector data. This requirement is met by a custom FPGA-based processing pipeline that performs the complete front-end data treatment fully in-stream, including common-mode correction, pedestal subtraction, ion-tail filtering, zero suppression, and dense data packing.   A central element of the design is a highly parallel common-mode correction algorithm operating directly on the streaming data. It robustly identifies signal-free readout channels on a time-bin basis and applies pad-dependent scaling to compensate for local variations in capacitive coupling in the GEM readout. In combination with pedestal subtraction and ion-tail filtering, this enables accurate baseline restoration under extreme high-occupancy conditions, preventing signal loss while efficiently suppressing noise prior to zero suppression.   The pipeline operates continuously at the full detector bandwidth and reduces the raw input rate to about 900 GB/s for Pb-Pb collisions at the target interaction rate. Overall, it represents a large-scale FPGA-based real-time signal-processing implementation for high-energy physics detector readout.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the dynamics of antiferromagnetic dimers within a Rydberg atom chain in the regime where laser detuning compensates for nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions. Using an effective PXQ model, we demonstrate that the associated Hilbert space decomposes into disconnected, dimer-conserving subspaces. The classification of these subspaces is provided, and the computational basis states spanning them are identified. Through a combination of analytical mapping and numerical simulations, we compare the dynamics of the PXQ model with those of the full Rydberg atom chain. The deviations are attributed to two factors, laser-induced leakage from the constrained Hilbert subspace and the influence of long-range interactions beyond the NN limit. Our results indicate that subspace leakage can be mitigated by increasing the NN interaction strength. While this simultaneously amplifies the effects of long-range interactions, the conservation of the dimer number remains. Our study opens up possibilities for exploring the dynamics of antiferromagnetic dimers using the Rydberg atom quantum simulator.",

Three cases are considered: 1 atm/298 K, 5 atm/472 K, and 20 atm/700 K, scaled to maintain the same jet Reynolds number and nominal Karlovitz number in the unburnt mixture, enabling a direct comparison of flame-turbulence interactions. Although the combined effects are moderate overall due to compensating influences, measurable differences arise in flame structure and turbulence-flame coupling. They are driven by reduced turbulence dissipation within the flame at high pressure and temperature, which enhances the interaction between turbulence and thermodiffusive effects. Finally, the tangential strain rate exhibits the same universal Kolmogorov scaling observed in homogeneous-isotropic turbulence and in methane flames, confirming its robustness for modelling turbulence",

Particular attention is devoted to a detailed analysis of the method based on observing a lunar eclipse to simultaneously measure longitude differences: the necessary conditions and organization of the experiment, the instruments employed, the mathematical calculations, and error estimates are described. The longitude difference obtained by al-Biruni and al-Buzjani is compared with modern values.

    "abstract": "Metal - organic nanocomposite thin films represent a versatile class of materials whose properties can be effectively tuned through external stimuli. In this study, Ag+C60 and Au+C60 nanocomposite thin films were briefly investigated to elucidate the effects of ion irradiation on both their morphology and electrical properties. The films were synthesized by co-deposition of noble metals and fullerenes, using ion beam sputtering of metal targets combined with simultaneous thermal evaporation of C60. The as - deposited films were characterized by ion beam analysis to determine their composition and element depth distributions. Subsequently, the samples were irradiated at room temperature with either a continuous Ar ion beam or a pulsed C ion beam, both at an energy of 20 keV and a fluence of 1 x 1015 ions/cm2. Irradiation-induced morphological changes were examined by scanning electron microscopy. While the C-irradiated films retained compact and homogeneous surface morphologies, Ar irradiation induced pronounced surface restructuring, resulting in highly corrugated and porous-like surfaces. In addition to morphology, the electrical resistance of the films was measured. The results indicate that C-irradiated samples exhibit only minor changes in resistivity, whereas Ar irradiation strongly affects the electrical properties, with the most significant impact observed for the Au+C60 system. The observed changes in electrical resistance closely correlate with the irradiation-induced surface morphology. The measurement results are briefly discussed below.",

    "abstract": "Lithium niobate sees widespread use in nonlinear and quantum optical devices, such as for sum- and difference-frequency generation or spontaneous parametric down-conversion. In lithium niobate waveguides, nonlinear optical processes are often limited by the so-called photorefractive effect, which limits the maximum input or output powers and impacts the nonlinear spectral response. Therefore, strategies for the management of photorefractive damage are a key consideration in device design. Usually, the photorefractive damage threshold, i.e. the maximal permissible operating power, can be increased by high temperature operation of devices. This approach, however, is not applicable in cryogenic environments, which may be required for specialized applications. To better understand the impact of photorefraction in nonlinear optical applications, we study the impact of photorefraction on the phase-matching spectra of two nonlinear-optical sum-frequency generation experiments at 1) high temperatures and 2) cryogenic temperatures. Furthermore, we present an approach to reduce the impact of photorefraction which is compatible with cryogenic operation. This comprises an auxiliary light source, propagating in the same waveguide, which is used to restore phase-matching spectra impacted by photorefraction, as well as reduce pyroelectric effects. Our work provides an alternative route to photorefraction management applicable to cryogenic environments, as well as in situations with tight energy budgets like space applications.",

    "abstract": "Accurate determination of fireball direction is essential for retrieving trajectories and velocities. Errors in these measurements have significant implications, affecting the calculated pre-impact orbit, influencing mass estimates, and impacting the accuracy of dark flight simulations, where applicable. Here we implement a new atmospheric refraction correction technique that addresses a significant aspect previously overlooked in the field of meteor science. Traditional refraction correction techniques, originally designed for objects positioned at infinite distances, tend to overcompensate when applied to objects within the Earth's atmosphere. To rectify this issue, our study introduces the concept of the atmospheric refraction delta z correction technique, involving the artificial elevation of the observer site height above sea level. We utilize analytically derived formulas for the delta z correction in conjunction with commonly used refraction models, validating these results against a numerical solution that traces light rays through the atmosphere. This ray-tracing model is applied to finely meshed atmospheric layers, yielding precise correction values. We evaluate multiple sources of error in order to quantify the achievable accuracy of the proposed method. Our approach (1) enables the determination of fireball positions with improved astrometric accuracy, (2) removes the explicit dependence on the fireball distance from the observer or its height above Earth's surface within the limits imposed by realistic atmospheric variability, and (3) simplifies meteor data processing by providing a robust framework for analyzing low-elevation fireball observations, for which atmospheric refraction is significant and is automatically corrected by the method. As a result of this work, we provide open, publicly accessible software for calculating the delta z correction.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a numerical study of the dynamics of DNA double helix breakage under the influence of external forces using the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois (PBD) model. The PBD model represents DNA as a chain of nonlinearly coupled oscillators, which makes it possible to analyze the processes of melting and mechanical denaturation. The main focus is on cases where an external force is applied to the terminal or central site of a DNA molecule, simulating stretching at a constant rate. The critical force required to break hydrogen bonds, which depends on the point of application of the force, is calculated. It is found that the denaturation process occurs stepwise, with characteristic peaks in the force-time graphs. The phenomenon of hysteresis under periodic exposure to external forces is also studied, which is important for understanding energy losses and heating of the system.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient wave-optics simulation of partially coherent light transport systems is critical for the design of advanced optical systems, ranging from computational lithography to diffraction-limited storage rings (DLSR). However, traditional approaches based on Coherent Mode Decomposition suffer from high computational costs due to the propagating massive sets of two-dimensional modes. In this paper, we propose the Coherent Mode Decoupling (CMDC) algorithm, a high-throughput computational framework designed to accelerate these simulations by orders of magnitude without compromising physical fidelity. The method factorizes 2D modes into efficient one-dimensional (1D) components, while crucially incorporating a subspace compression strategy to capture non-separable coupling effects. We demonstrated the generality and robustness of this framework in applications ranging from computational lithography to coherent beamlines of DLSR.",

    "abstract": "Reliable identification of microplastic fibers is crucial for environmental monitoring but remains analytically challenging. We report an explainable deep-learning framework for classifying microplastic and natural microfibers using polarization-resolved digital holographic microscopy. From multiplexed holograms, the complex Jones matrix of each fiber was reconstructed to extract polarization eigen-parameters describing optical anisotropy. Statistical descriptors of nine polarization characteristics formed a 72-dimensional feature vector for a total of 296 fibers spanning six material classes, including polyamide 6, polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide 6.6, polypropylene, cotton and wool. The designed fully connected deep neural network achieved an accuracy of 96.7 % on the validation data, surpassing that of common machine-learning classifiers. Explainable artificial intelligence analysis with Shapley additive explanations identified eigenvalue-ratio quantities as dominant predictors, revealing the physical basis for classification. An additional reduced-feature model with the preserved architecture exploiting only these most significant eigenvalue-based characteristics retained high accuracy (93.3 %), thereby confirming their dominant role while still outperforming common machine-learning classifiers. These results establish polarization-based features as distinctive optical fingerprints and demonstrate the first explainable deep-learning approach for automated microplastic fiber identification.",

    "abstract": "We use the high-resolution Swarm faceplate plasma density data at 16 Hz to develop a set of parameters that can characterize multi-scale ionospheric structures and irregularities along the Swarm orbit. We present the methods for calculating density gradients over different window sizes, rate of change of density index, power spectral density and the spectral slope at both low and high latitudes. The faceplate plasma data are not continuously available through the years. However, about 8 years of data from Swarm A are processed from late 2014 to the end of 2025. Some statistical results from Swarm A are presented. The variations of plasma structures and irregularities are dependent on solar activity, season, local time and geomagnetic activities, and the variations show different patterns between low and high latitudes. For example, the high-latitude ionosphere is characterized by persistent ionospheric structures and irregularities poleward of 60 magnetic latitude, while the low-latitude ionospheric irregularities are only dominant during 19-01 local time near the magnetic equator. The occurrence of steep spectral slope at high latitudes shows clear seasonal variations, i.e., it maximizes during local summer and minimizes during local winter in both hemispheres. However, the occurrence of steep spectral slope at low latitudes is only sensible when significant plasma structures and irregularities are present. We further calculate the histogram of spectral slopes at low latitudes when the rate of change of density index is enhanced. The histogram resembles a Gaussian distribution with an expected value of 1.97. The processed data are available to the wider community. Given the high resolution, this new data product will be useful for the scientific communities that are interested in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling and near-Earth space environment.",

    "abstract": "Tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5), as a silicon-photonic-compatible material platform, has garnered significant attention for high-performance integrated photonics due to its exceptional properties: a broad transparency window spanning from 0.28 um to 8 um, a moderate refractive index of 2.05 at 1550 nm, and an impressive nonlinear refractive index of 7.2X10^(-19) m^2/W. Despite these advantages, achieving low-loss fabrication of monolithic microrings on the Ta2O5 platform remains challenging due to its inherent hardness and brittleness, which often result in rough sidewalls and significant scattering losses. In this work, we successfully demonstrated monolithic Ta2O5 microring resonators with exceptionally high intrinsic and loaded quality (Q) factors. This was accomplished through the innovative application of photolithography-assisted chemo-mechanical etching (PLACE) technology. By optimizing the coupling region between the microring and the bus waveguide, as well as meticulously controlling surface roughness during fabrication, we achieved near-critical coupling in the resulting microrings. The devices exhibited loaded Q factors of 2.74X10(6) in the telecom band without employing expensive electron-beam lithography, showing an intrinsic Q factor as high as 4.47X10(6) and a low propagation loss of only 0.0732 dB/cm - representing the highest results reported for strongly confined Ta2O5-based microring resonators to date. This work paves the way for the development of advanced photonic devices on the Ta2O5 platform with low manufacturing cost, including low-threshold microlasers, highly sensitive sensors, broad bandwidth supercontinuum sources, and optical frequency combs.",

    "title": "Blue to Near-IR Integrated PZT Silicon Nitride Modulators for Quantum and Atomic Applications",
    "abstract": "Modulation and control of lasers and optical signals is necessary for trapped-ion and cold neutral atom quantum systems. Given the diversity of atomic species, experimental modalities, and architectures, integrated optical modulators designed to operate across the visible to near-infrared spectrum are a key step towards portable, robust, and compact quantum computers, clocks, and sensors. Integrated optical modulators that are wavelength-independent, CMOS-compatible, and capable of maintaining low waveguide losses and a high resonator quality factor, DC-coupled broadband frequency response, and low power consumption, are essential for scalable photonic integration. Yet progress towards these goals has remained limited. Here we demonstrate four types of integrated stress-optic lead zirconate titanate (PZT) silicon nitride modulators: a coil Mach-Zehnder modulator, a coil pure phase modulator, and bus-coupled and add-drop ring resonator modulators, with operation from 493 nm to 780 nm. The coil MZM operates at 532 nm with a V$π$ of 2.8V, a 0.4 MHz 3-dB bandwidth, and an extinction ratio of 21.5dB. The coil phase modulator operates at 493 nm with a V$π$ of 2.8V and low residual amplitude modulation of -34 dB at a 1kHz offset. The bus-coupled ring resonator modulator operates at 493 nm and the add-drop ring resonator modulator operates at 780 nm. The ring-based modulators have an intrinsic quality factor of 3.4 million and 1.9 million, a linear tuning strength of 0.9 GHz/V and 1 GHz/V, and a 3-dB bandwidth of 2.6 MHz and 10 MHz, respectively. All four modulator designs maintain the low optical waveguide loss of SiN, are DC coupled with broadband frequency response, operate independent of wavelength, and consume only tens of nW per actuator. Such solutions unlock the potential for further integration with other precision SiN components to realize chip-scale atomic and quantum systems.",

Here, we introduce a minimal reaction-diffusion model that captures the essential dynamics of a cooperative supramolecular polymerization network driven by monomer activation and deactivation. We show that a balance between autocatalytic growth and inhibitory decay sustains a nonequilibrium steady state in the model that undergoes a Hopf bifurcation, giving rise to autonomous oscillations. When spatial transport is introduced through diffusion, the system displays rich spatiotemporal phenomena, such as traveling wavefronts and transient polygonal patterns. Our results demonstrate that the interplay between reaction kinetics and diffusion can spontaneously generate self-organized, life-like dynamics in synthetic supramolecular polymer systems. This theoretical framework not only bridges molecular self-assembly and active matter dynamics but also provides design principles for creating adaptive, oscillatory, and self-patterning materials powered by chemical fuels.",

This potential produces radial transport similar to that of diffusion coefficient $D_{ef}= (Δ/a_T)T_e/eB$. $Δ$ is the radial distance over which the potential $Φ$ is correlated by the electron motion along the chaotic magnetic field, and $|dT_e/dr| = T_e/a_T$. The chaos-produced electron transport gives an effective viscosity on the electron flow, which can counter balance a non-ambipolar part of the ion radial particle diffusion $f_{na}$. This non-ambipolarity would otherwise require a radial electric field that confines ions and hence impurities. The maximum $f_{na}$ that can be counterbalanced and the required plasma beta to avoid shielding the magnetic perturbations $\\tilde{B}$ are calculated.",

Using accessible non-classical resources, weak squeezing and displacement, we construct a squeezed state and two superposed states: the squeezed cat state and the symmetrically squeezed state. Their photon-added variants are compared with parity-matched cat and KSs using quantum Fisher information and fidelity. The QFI isocontours reveal regimes where KS exhibit high fidelity and large amplitude, enabling their preparation via Gaussian operations and photon addition. Similar regimes are identified for cat states enhanced by squeezing and photon addition, demonstrating improved metrological performance. Moreover, increased amplitude and thus larger phase-space area reduces the size of interferometric fringes, enhancing the effectiveness of quantum error correction in cat codes.",

    "abstract": "Planck-scale physics challenges the classical smooth-spacetime picture by introducing quantum fluctuations that imply a nontrivial spacetime microstructure. We present a framework that encodes these fluctuations by promoting local scale factors, rather than the metric tensor, to fundamental dynamical variables while preserving general covariance. The construction employs a two-tiered hierarchy of scale manifolds, comprising a first-order manifold of scale coordinates and a second-order manifold of fluctuation amplitude coordinates. On the first-order manifold, we formulate differential geometry, field equations, and a canonical quantization procedure. The theory yields a geometric renormalization-group flow for scale variables and implies spacetime discreteness at the microscopic level. By constructing a quadratic action and performing spectral decomposition with a stabilizing potential, we obtain discrete modal degrees of freedom quantized as harmonic oscillators. The framework proposes a microscopic description for zero-point energy of spacetime and explores implications for vacuum energy and ultraviolet regularization, suggesting a potential dynamical mechanism that could ameliorate the cosmological constant problem. Main results include a generalized uncertainty relation with scale-dependent coefficients, locally scaled Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations, geodesic equations for scale spacetime, and a microscopic area operator whose state counting is consistent with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. This work develops a scale-based quantization procedure, providing a foundation for further mathematical analysis and phenomenological tests of spacetime quantization.",

    "abstract": "Elastoinertial turbulence (EIT) is a self-sustaining chaotic state resulting from the interplay between inertia and elasticity in the flow of dilute polymeric solutions, and its emergence is believed to limit the achievable drag reduction in turbulence flow using polymer additives. In the present study, we introduce a viscoelastic variant of spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (VESPOD) that decomposes velocity and polymeric stress fields of EIT together into well-defined orthogonal oscillating modes such that the decomposition is optimal in the terms of the total mechanical energy of the flow. Using this technique, we investigate the dominant coherently evolving structures underlying the dynamics of EIT in axisymmetric pipe flow. By analyzing distinct peaks in the leading eigenvalue of the VESPOD eigenvalue spectrum, we find that the dynamics of EIT in pipe flow is dominated by three distinct families of traveling waves, where the higher wavenumber structures of each family are simple harmonics of their respective fundamental waves. The radial velocity fields of the traveling waves are characterized by the formation of large-scale structures spanning the pipe radial direction. However, the polymeric stress fields corresponding to them are characterized by the formation of thin inclined sheets of high stress fluctuations at the critical layers of the respective waves, i.e.~ the locations where the wave speed of the VESPOD mode matches the mean streamwise velocity. Additionally, these sheets exhibit nested structures, where the polymeric sheets of faster waves are confined by those of the immediately slower waves.",

Using polarization- and time-resolved real-space imaging, we directly visualize a symmetry-breaking spatial separation of polaritons from opposite valleys under linearly polarized excitation, accompanied by an ultrafast Hall drift velocity on the order of 10^5 m/s. This behaviour cannot be accounted for by conventional cavity-induced mechanisms and instead points to a strain-induced synthetic pseudomagnetic field acting on the excitonic component of polaritons.

    "abstract": "Ultrafast laser welding provides a promising approach for high precision integration of transparent and metallic materials. However, its practical application remains constrained by the precise regulation of the interfacial gap. This study investigates the interfacial response and bonding mechanism of sapphire and Fe-36Ni alloy joints under controlled non-optical contact conditions using burst mode ultrafast laser irradiation. A polymer interlayer was introduced between naturally stacked samples to establish a variable interfacial gap, allowing systematic evaluation of gap-dependent morphology, melting behavior, and elemental transport. By redistributing the pulse energy into sequential sub-pulses, the burst mode reconstructs the temporal energy-deposition process, yielding enhanced plasma-material coupling and stable thermal accumulation. Compared with single pulse irradiation, burst mode sustains continuous bonding across gaps exceeding 10 um--far beyond the failure threshold of the single pulse mode--and forms a fusion zone 82% larger. Fracture surface and cross-sectional analyses of SEM and EDS results confirm that sequential sub-pulses promote extensive sapphire melting, droplet-driven gap bridging, and enhanced Al-Fe interdiffusion at the interface. These results provide a scientific basis for high-gap-tolerance ultrafast laser welding and scalable integration of transparent-metal hybrid components in advanced optoelectronic and precision engineering applications.",

    "abstract": "Understanding electron energy dynamics in low-temperature plasmas such as capacitively coupled plasmas (CCPs), including energy absorption, conversion, transport, and dissipation, is essential for interpreting discharge physics and process applications. We propose a kinetic-moment framework based on particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision (PIC/MCC) simulations. The framework reconstructs the first three velocity moments of the Boltzmann equation directly from PIC/MCC data and enables a quantitative, self-consistent description of electron energy dynamics in low-pressure CCPs. To clarify energy conversion among electromagnetic energy, electron fluid kinetic (mechanical) energy, and electron thermal (internal) energy, we further separate the total energy transport equation into kinetic- and thermal-energy equations. We find that, at low pressure, electrons gain directed kinetic energy in the sheath and convert it locally into thermal energy through pressure-strain interaction and collisions. Thermal energy is then transported into the bulk and is dissipated mainly by inelastic electron-neutral collisions. We further decompose pressure-strain interaction into reversible pressure dilatation and irreversible viscous-like dissipation, which correspond to conversion driven by volumetric compression or expansion and by shear deformation, respectively. This decomposition reveals a significant thermalization channel beyond collisions. More broadly, the results show coexistence of localized kinetic-to-thermal conversion near the sheath and nonlocal energy transport from the sheath to the bulk dominated by microscopic heat flux. The heat flux deviates strongly from Fourier's law based on local temperature gradients. This framework provides a clear fluid description with kinetic fidelity and offers a practical tool for analyzing energy evolution in nonequilibrium plasmas.",

    "title": "Adaptive information-maximization encoding for ghost imaging--A general Bayesian framework under experimental physical constraints",
    "abstract": "Ghost imaging (GI) has demonstrated diverse imaging capabilities enabled by its encoding-decoding-based computational imaging mechanism. Accordingly, information-theoretic studies have emerged as a promising avenue for probing the fundamental performance bounds of of GI and related computational imaging paradigms. However, the design of information-theoretically optimal encoding strategies remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the intractability of the prior probability density function (PDF) of an unknown scene. Here, by leveraging the ability of recursively estimating the PDF of the object to be imaged via Bayesian filtering, we propose to establish an adaptive information-maximization encoding (AIME) design framework. Based on the adaptively estimated posterior PDF from previously acquired measurements, the expected information gain of subsequent detections is evaluated and maximized to design the corresponding encoding patterns in a closed-loop manner. Within this framework, the theoretical form of the information-optimal encoding under representative physical constraints is analytically derived. Corresponding experimental results show that, GI systems employing information-optimal encoding achieve markedly improved imaging performance compared with conventional fixed point-to-point imaging without relying on additional heuristic regularization schemes, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio regimes. Moreover, the proposed strategy consistently enables significantly enhanced information acquisition capability compared with existing encoding strategies, leading to substantially improved imaging quality. These results establish a principled information-theoretic foundation for optimal encoding design in computational imaging paradigms,provided that the forward model can be accurately characterized.",

    "abstract": "The conformal integration of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center nanodiamond arrays onto soft, hydrated, curvilinear biological interfaces remain a fundamental challenge for in vivo quantum sensing and imaging. Conventional transfer techniques often fail due to reliance on high temperature, corrosive chemicals, or mechanical peeling, leading to pattern damage, low fidelity, or poor biocompatibility. Here, we report a transfer strategy utilizing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) carrier soluble tape, enabling rapid, residue-free, high-fidelity transfer of nanodiamond patterns onto diverse biointerfaces. The success of this method is rooted in a unique \"hydrate-soften-expand-self-peel\" mechanism of the soluble tape with PVA backing. In situ mechanical tracking reveals non-uniform PVA swelling upon hydration generates transient local normal and shear stresses at the interface. These stresses delaminate the tape within 3 minutes at room temperature while promoting adhesion of the nanodiamond array to the substrate. In contrast, conventional water-soluble tapes with composite structures undergo passive dissolution and collapse, causing residue contamination and reduced efficiency. Leveraging this mechanism, we achieve conformal patterning on ultra-soft hydrogels (~0.6 kPa) and highly curved bio-surfaces (hair, 100 μm^-1). Additionally, we demonstrate a dual-identity verification system integrating data storage and physical unclonable functions on a hydrogel contact lens. This work provides a versatile tool for bio-interface engineering and a general framework for gentle, efficient transfer of functional nanomaterials.",

When the {σh symmetry is gradually broken, the system undergoes a topological phase transition characterized by a Zak phase inversion, leading to a band inversion between quadrupole and dipole modes.

A key application of squeezed light is nonlinear microscopy, where state-of-the-art performance is limited by photodamage and quantum-limited noise. Such microscopes require bright, pulsed light for optimal operation, yet generating and detecting bright pulsed squeezing at high levels remains challenging. In this work, we present an efficient technique to generate high levels of bright picosecond pulsed squeezed light using a $χ^2$ optical parametric amplification process in a waveguide. We measure $-3.2~\\mathrm{dB}$ of bright squeezing with optical power compatible with nonlinear microscopy, as well as $-3.6~\\mathrm{dB}$ of vacuum squeezing. Corrected for losses, these squeezing levels correspond to $-15.4^{+2.7}_{-8.7}~\\mathrm{dB}$ of squeezing generated in the waveguide. The measured level of bright amplitude pulsed squeezing is to our knowledge the highest reported to date, and will contribute to the broader adoption of quantum-enhanced nonlinear microscopy in biological studies.",

    "abstract": "The global demand for green hydrogen and its derivatives is growing rapidly as a cornerstone for decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors. Morocco, endowed with abundant solar and wind resources, ambitions to capture up to 4% of the global PtX market by 2030, positioning itself as a strategic partner for Europe's energy transition. Yet, uncertainty persists regarding European demand trajectories, infrastructure readiness, and investment risks. This study evaluates Morocco's hydrogen transition through 2035 using a sector-coupled capacity expansion model. We compare industry reallocation and hydrogen export-oriented scenarios, assessing their impacts under interannual weather variability and financial sensitivities. Both scenarios require a tripling of current renewable and electrolyzer capacities, with hydrogen demand reaching approximately up to 38 TWh by 2035. Lower financing costs (WACC) have a greater effect on system costs and competitiveness than stricter CO2 constraints or weather variability. The trade- off between domestic energy security and export competitiveness is pronounced, but both pathways are technically feasible and aligned with Morocco's strategic energy goals. These findings provide evidence-based guidance for policymakers to balance Morocco's domestic and export ambitions in the evolving hydrogen market.",

    "abstract": "This work primarily focuses on the study of three gradient reconstruction techniques applied to the calculation of viscous terms in a cell-centered, finite volume formulation for general unstructured grids. The work also addresses different ways of formulating the limiter functions necessary to maintain stability in the presence of flow discontinuities. The flows of interest are simulated using the compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, and the negative Spalart-Allmaras model is used for turbulence closure. Definition of interface inviscid terms uses the Roe approximate Riemann solver, whereas the interface viscous terms are calculated with a standard centered scheme together with appropriate definitions of the interface gradients. Steady state solutions are obtained using an implicit time-integration method, together with a novel convergence acceleration technique. This new approach defines a set of three simple rules for controlling the global CFL number based on the residue evolution. The work considers three test cases, namely, the subsonic bump-in-channel flow, the subsonic NASA high-lift Common Research Model multielement airfoil and the transonic ONERA M6 wing. Present results are compared to experimental and numerical data available in the literature. Severe numerical instabilities are observed when the simplest gradient reconstruction technique is used, while more sophisticated formulations are able to provide excellent agreement with the existing literature. Current results are demonstrated to be highly insensitive to modifications made to the numerical flux entropy fix terms. Integrated aerodynamic forces are shown to be mildly dependent on the limiter formulation used, even in the absence of shock waves. The proposed convergence acceleration procedure manages to quickly drive the residue terms to machine zero, provided no major instabilities are present.",

    "abstract": "The effects induced by numerical schemes and mesh geometry on the solution of two-dimensional supersonic inviscid flows are investigated in the context of the compressible Euler equations. Five different finite-difference schemes are considered: the Beam and Warming implicit approximate factorization algorithm, the original Steger and Warming flux vector splitting algorithm, the van Leer approach on performing the flux vector splitting and two different novel finite-difference interpretations of the Liou AUSM+ scheme. Special focus is given to the shock wave resolution capabilities of each scheme for the solution of an external supersonic inviscid flows around a blunt body. Significant changes in the shock structure are observed, mainly due to special properties of the scheme in use and the influence of the domain transformation procedure. Perturbations in the supersonic flow upstream of the shock are also seen in the solution, which is a non-physical behavior. Freestream subtraction, flux limiting and the explicit addition of artificial dissipation are employed in order to circumvent these problems. One of the AUSM+ formulations presented here is seen to be particularly more robust in avoiding the appearance of some of these numerically-induced disturbances and non-physical characteristics in the solution. Good agreement is achieved with both numerical and experimental results available in the literature.}",

This study develops a computational framework of a Jackfish-inspired swimmer with an independently mounted caudal fin that pitches passively under fluid forces and a nonlinear torsional spring. The fin synchronizes with the body when damping and stiffness parameters are tuned correctly, producing passive pitching that closely resembles to the displacement of the actively pitching tail. At Re = 3000, synchronized passive pitching generates coherent hairpin and ring vortices that reinforce streamwise momentum and contribute to thrust, whereas larger phase differences lead to wake spread in lateral direction and drag-dominated behavior. These results reveal that nonlinear peduncle mechanics naturally regulate amplitude, phase, and recoil, offering a biologically inspired pathway toward underwater robotic design using passive kinematics.",

    "title": "Convolutional LSTM Surrogate for Mesoscale Hydrocode Simulations of Granular Wave Propagation",
    "abstract": "Granular materials subjected to impact loading exhibit highly heterogeneous spatiotemporal dynamics governed by wave propagation, pore collapse, and grain-scale rearrangements. Mesoscale hydrocodes resolve these processes but are computationally expensive, limiting their use in parametric studies and uncertainty quantification. In this work, we develop a convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) neural network as a spatiotemporal surrogate for mesoscale simulations of weak shock propagation in granular media. Using two-dimensional hydrocode simulations as training data, we first consider a simplified \"billiard break\" problem in which a cue ball impacts a cluster of nine circular balls, all deformable. Sequences of pressure-field images serve as input-output pairs for a sequence-to-sequence ConvLSTM, which is trained to predict future frames from a short history. We compare several architectures and show that a relatively compact encoder-decoder ConvLSTM accurately reproduces the propagation of the pressure wave and the resulting particle motion for an unseen combination of cue-ball position and impact velocity. As a proof-of-concept extension, we apply the same ConvLSTM framework to previously published mesoscale simulations of weak shock compaction in a granular ensemble. When evaluated at piston impact speeds that were completely withheld from training, the surrogate captures the position and shape of the compaction front and its dependence on impact speed, while smoothing fine pore-scale details in the highly compacted region as expected. These results demonstrate that ConvLSTM models can serve as satisfactory surrogates for spatiotemporal mesoscale simulations of granular wave propagation, enabling accelerated exploration of parameter space and laying the groundwork for physics-informed, mesoscale simulations of granular materials under shock loading.",

    "abstract": "Foundational machine-learned interatomic potentials have emerged as powerful tools for atomistic simulations, promising near first-principles accuracy across diverse chemical spaces at a fraction of the cost of quantum-mechanical calculations. However, the most accurate equivariant architectures rely on Clebsch-Gordan tensor products whose computational cost scales steeply with angular resolution, creating a trade-off between model expressiveness and inference speed that ultimately limits practical applications. Here we introduce Geodite, an equivariant message-passing architecture that replaces tensor products while incorporating physical priors to ensure smooth, well-behaved potential energy surfaces. Trained on the Materials Project trajectories dataset of inorganic crystals, Geodite-MP achieves accuracy competitive with leading methods on benchmarks for materials stability prediction, thermal conductivity, phonon-derived properties, and nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics, while running $3\\text{--}5\\times$ faster than models performing similarly. By combining predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and physicality, Geodite enables faster large-scale atomistic simulations and high-throughput screening that would otherwise be computationally prohibitive.",

Successful implementation of such resonators calls for detailed microscopic understanding of their mode profiles, energy dissipation channels, and imperfections from microfabrication.

The Gaussian mode profile tightly confined by reflecting mirrors is vividly seen in the TMIM images, from which the linewidth of the resonator itself can be extracted.

    "abstract": "Biological membranes are dynamic surfaces whose shape and function are critically influenced by protein inclusions (PIs). While membrane deformations induced by PIs have been extensively studied in the small-deformation regime, a variety of processes involves strong membrane deformations. We investigate the interaction between lipid membranes and PIs in the large deformation (LD) regime, with the finite-element method. We develop an approximate analytical solution that captures key features of the LD regime. We show that the force exerted by the membrane on a PI displays a non-monotonic behavior with respect to the PI vertical displacement. The qualitative features of this force appear to be independent of the protein geometry. For two interacting PIs, the membrane-mediated potential exhibits sub-power-law decay with inter-protein distance, reflecting the complex nature of the elastic medium. The interaction potential shows that conical PIs with identical and opposite orientations repel and attract, respectively, confirming the analogy between PI orientation and electric charge, in the LD regime. In the presence of membrane flows, we identify a characteristic velocity that separates two regimes in which bending rigidity and viscous effects dominate, respectively, implying the onset of flow-induced deformations above such velocity threshold. Overall, our results provide quantitative predictions for membrane-protein systems in biologically relevant scenarios involving LDs, with implications for protein sorting, clustering, and membrane trafficking.",

    "abstract": "Millimeter-wave oscillators underpin key applications in communication, spectroscopy, radar, and astronomy, yet their achievable spectral purity remains limited. Approaches that directly generate millimeter-wave carriers are fundamentally limited by quantum and thermal phase-noise processes. Here we show that these limits can be overcome by combining Kerr-induced optical frequency division in a chip-scale microresonator with a large-spacing dual-wavelength Brillouin laser. This 3.3 THz optical reference injection-locks a Kerr soliton microcomb, with a repetition rate that becomes a coherently divided 300 GHz carrier with phase noise below the quantum limit of a corresponding 300 GHz dual-wavelength Brillouin laser and far below the thermo-refractive noise of a microring resonator. Cross-correlation phase-noise measurements were developed to show that the resulting oscillator reaches a phase-noise floor of -152 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset, consistent with photodetection shot noise. Integration of the measured spectrum yields an RMS timing jitter of 135 as from 1 kHz to 1 MHz. These results establish optical frequency division as a generic method for generation of sub-terahertz carriers with coherence no longer constrained by direct-generation limits.",

    "title": "Bayesian identification of fibrous insulation thermal conductivity towards design of spacecraft thermal protection systems",
    "abstract": "The design of spacecraft thermal protection systems (TPS) requires accurate knowledge of thermal transport properties across wide ranges of temperature and pressure. For fibrous insulation, conventional measurement techniques in laboratory settings are typically limited to temperatures much lower than what is reached in atmosphere entry scenarios. Moreover, it is often the case that only temperature measurements are available, meaning that the thermal conductivity of the insulation must be indirectly inferred as an inverse problem. We propose a Bayesian framework using information field theory (IFT) to reconstruct the thermal conductivity of high-temperature fibrous insulation from sparse experimental data. Under IFT, the conductivity is represented as a Gaussian process, and the physics is enforced via a physics-informed prior over the temperature derived from the heat equation. Bayes's rule produces an infinite-dimensional posterior distribution that quantifies uncertainty about the conductivity which can be evaluated in extrapolation regimes. We apply the method to Opacified Fibrous Insulation with both synthetic and experimental data to reconstruct the thermal conductivity beyond the experimental regime. The inferred conductivities are validated against reference data and then propagated into high-fidelity digital twins of flexible TPS performance under Mars and Earth entry trajectories. The results show that IFT yields accurate predictions with quantified uncertainty, enabling robust TPS sizing in regimes inaccessible to direct measurement.",

    "abstract": "Graphynes offer a chemically heterogeneous $sp/sp^{2}$ carbon framework with distinct electronic regimes and site-selective reactivity. Here, Density Functional Theory and Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulations are combined to evaluate pristine, B-doped, N-doped, and B-N co-doped $γ$-graphyne and 6,6,12-graphyne (meta/ortho/para). $γ$-graphyne is a semiconductor, while 6,6,12-graphyne exhibits an anisotropic Dirac-like semi-metallic dispersion. B/N substitution reconstructs near-$E_F$ states via dopant $π$ hybridization, and B-N pairing stabilizes defects through donor-acceptor compensation, with the ortho substitutions being the most favorable. Hydrogen adsorption remains weak on pristine lattices but becomes locally optimized upon doping, with near thermo-neutral $ΔG_{\\mathrm{ads}}$ 'hot spots' predominantly on $sp$-proximate carbon sites adjacent to the dopants. Reactive MD at 300 K further reveals an activity stability trade-off: B-N ortho in $γ$-graphyne sustains controlled hydrogen uptake without catastrophic bond scission, whereas B-N meta/para degrade, and 6,6,12-graphyne is generally more susceptible to over-hydrogenation. These results identify the B-N geometry as a key design variable for graphyne-based HER catalysts, which require both a favorable $ΔG_{\\mathrm{ads}}$ and finite-temperature hydrogenation stability.",

    "title": "Asymptotic scaling theory of electrostatic turbulent transport in magnetised fusion plasmas",
    "abstract": "Turbulent transport remains one of the principal obstacles to achieving efficient magnetic confinement in fusion devices. Two of the dominant drivers of the turbulence are microscale instabilities fuelled by electron- and ion-temperature gradients (ETG and ITG), whose nonlinear saturation determines the cross-field transport of particles and energy. Despite decades of study, predictive modelling of this turbulence has been limited either to expensive gyrokinetic simulations or to reduced models calibrated by fitting to numerical or experimental data, restricting their utility for reactor design. Here we present a simple asymptotic scaling theory that unifies ETG- and ITG-driven turbulence within a common framework. By balancing the fundamental time scales of linear growth, nonlinear decorrelation, and parallel propagation, the theory isolates the dependence of the heat flux on equilibrium parameters to two key quantities: the parallel system scale and the outer-scale aspect ratio. We show that these quantities encapsulate the essential physics of saturation, leading to distinct predictions for ETG and ITG transport: a cubic scaling with the temperature gradient in the electron channel, and a linear scaling in the ion channel. Extensive nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations confirm that these theoretical predictions hold irrespective of the magnetic geometry (slab, tokamak, or stellarator), including the first numerical confirmation of the cubic ETG scaling anticipated by earlier theory. By isolating the dependence on just the parallel system scale and the outer-scale aspect ratio, our framework provides a physics-based foundation for fast, geometry-aware transport models, offering a pathway toward reactor optimisation in both tokamaks and stellarators.",

    "abstract": "Quantum theory is widely regarded as fundamentally indeterministic, yet classical frameworks can also exhibit indeterminism once infinite information is abandoned. At the same time, relativity is usually taken to forbid superluminal signalling, yet Lorentz symmetry formally admits superluminal transformations (SpTs). Dragan and Ekert have argued that SpTs entail indeterminism analogous to the quantum one. Here, we derive a no-go theorem from natural assumptions, which can be interpreted as: superluminal transformations (SpTs) and finite information cannot coexist. Any theory accommodating SpTs must therefore allow unbounded information content, leading to a deterministic ontology akin to that of classical theories formulated over the real numbers. Thus, any apparent indeterminism arising from superluminal transformations reflects only probabilities arising from subjective ignorance, unlike the objective nature of probabilities in quantum theory, indicating that the claimed indeterminacy from superluminal extensions is not quantum.",

We examine di!erent initial conditions for the particle loop, including configurations that are elliptic in space at a given time and configurations that are elliptic in spacetime at a fixed propagation distance. Furthermore, employing a non-uniform mass distribution allows the particle loop to mimic the STVP not only in configuration space but also in momentum space. Remarkably, when supplemented by a semiclassical vorticity quantization condition, our mechanical model exactly reproduces di!erent wave-based OAM results previously reported for paraxial STVPs.",

To discern the physical mechanisms governing the spreading dynamics, we present a simplified theoretical model, validated by impact experiments, to quantify how fluid elasticity modifies the maximal spreading of impacting droplets. Experiments were performed using fluids within a narrow range of viscosity and surface tension, but varying relaxation time. While following similar asymptotic scalings as Newtonian droplets, the maximum diameter for viscoelastic droplets exhibits a clear deviation from Newtonian behaviour only when the Deborah number is of order unity. The maximum spread diameter is reduced by as much as 40% from the expected value for Newtonian fluid. These results support the central prediction of our model: an extension of classical energy balance that incorporates viscoelastic effects through a single correction factor. The model captures the observed reduction in maximal spreading and predicts both the location and magnitude of the most substantial viscoelastic effects, providing a basis for extending impact models beyond purely Newtonian fluids.",

In this work, we demonstrate that normal modes, often synonymously considered as phonons in solids, provide a microscopic description of various transport processes, including thermal conductivity, diffusion coefficient, and shear viscosity, in a prototypical dilute gas, argon. Our results reveal that normal modes constitute elementary excitations in dilute gases, extending their physical relevance far beyond vibrational excitations in solids.",

    "abstract": "Contagion processes in social systems often involve interactions that go beyond pairwise contacts. Higher-order networks, represented as hypergraphs, have been widely used to model multi-body interactions, and their presence can drastically alter contagion dynamics compared to traditional network models. However, existing analytical approaches typically assume independence between pairwise and higher-order degrees, and thus study their roles in isolation. In this paper, we develop an effective hyperdegree model (EHDM) to describe Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) dynamics on hypergraphs that explicitly captures correlations between the distribution of groups with different sizes. Our effective hyperdegree model shows excellent agreement with stochastic simulations across different types of higher-order networks, including those with heterogeneous degree distributions. We explore the critical role of cross-order degree correlations, specifically, whether nodes that are hubs in pairwise interactions also serve as hubs in higher-order interactions. We show that positive correlation decreases the epidemic threshold and anti-correlation temporally desynchronizes infection pathways (pairwise and group interactions). Finally, we demonstrate that, depending on the level of correlation, the optimal control strategy shifts -- from one that is purely pairwise- or higher-order-focused to one in which a mixed strategy becomes optimal.",

    "title": "Purcell enhanced electroluminescence of a unipolar light emitting quantum device at 10 micron",
    "abstract": "Efficient generation of radiation in the mid- and far- infrared relies primarily on lasers and coherent nonlinear optical phenomena driven by lasers. This wavelength range lacks of luminescent devices because the spontaneous emission rate becomes much longer than the nonradiative energy relaxation processes and therefore emitters have to count on stimulated emission produced by linear or non-linear optical gain. However, spontaneous emission is not a fundamental property of the emitter. By engineering metamaterials composed of arrays of nano-emitters into microcavities coupled to patch antennas, we have demonstrated mid-infrared electroluminescent devices emitting a collimated beam with excellent spatial properties and a factor 100 increase in the collected power, compared to standard devices. Our results illustrate that by reshaping the photonic environment around emitting dipoles, as in the Purcell effect, it is possible to enhance the spontaneous emission and conceive efficient optoelectronic light emitting devices that operate close to the thermodynamical equilibrium as LEDs in the visible range.",

    "abstract": "We investigate a single-laser scheme for reaching the strong-field QED regime based on direct laser acceleration (DLA) of electrons followed by their head-on collision with the same laser pulse reflected from an overdense foil. In this configuration, electrons are first accelerated inside an underdense plasma by a relativistic laser pulse and subsequently interact with the reflected laser field, emitting high-energy photons via nonlinear Compton scattering which decay into electron-positron pairs through the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process. Using analytical scalings supported by quasi-3D particle-in-cell simulations including QED effects, we demonstrate that a laser pulse with power as low as 2 PW is sufficient to reach the quantum regime characterized by $χ_e> 1$ . For higher powers, we observe a rapid nonlinear increase in the number of generated positrons, reaching more than 2 nC for a 10 PW laser pulse with energy of approximately 1.1 kJ. A semi-analytical model is employed to estimate the positron yield, showing good agreement with simulation results. We further study the influence of laser depletion and the positioning of the reflecting foil on the efficiency of pair production. The presented scheme provides an experimentally feasible platform for probing strong-field QED effects using currently available multi-petawatt laser systems.",

Here, we report a noncollinear magnetic ground state of Fe$_{4}$Nb$_{2}$O$_{9}$. To examine the magnetoelectric effect associated with sequential magnetic and structural transitions upon cooling, we conducted combined x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, dielectric constant, and magnetodielectric experiments. Powder neutron diffraction experiments revealed a series of magnetic Bragg peaks and clear splitting of peaks via structural transition. Magnetic Rietveld refinements, combined with group theory analysis, determined a noncollinear antiferromagnetic structure including a significant $c$-axis moment component at 1.5 K.

Large amplitude of the predicted effect may compensate for the smallness of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, making the equilibrium spin currents to be experimentally observed.

    "abstract": "Probing energy-dependent transport in quantum simulators requires preparing states with tunable energy and small energy variance. Existing approaches often study quench dynamics of simple initial states, such as computational basis states, which are far from energy eigenstates and therefore limit the achievable energy resolution. In this work, we propose using wavepackets to probe transport properties with improved energy resolution. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we prepare and evolve wavepackets on Quantinuum's H2-2 quantum computer and identify an energy-dependent localization transition in the Anderson model on an 8x7 lattice--a finite-size mobility edge. We observe that a wavepacket initialized at low energy remains spatially localized under time evolution, while a high-energy wavepacket delocalizes, consistent with the presence of a mobility edge. Crucial to our experiments is an error mitigation strategy that infers the noiseless output bit string distribution using maximum-likelihood estimation. Compared to post-selection, this method removes systematic errors and reduces statistical uncertainty by up to a factor of 5. We extend our methods to the many-particle regime by developing a quantum algorithm for preparing quasiparticle wavepackets in a one-dimensional model of interacting fermions. This technique has modest quantum resource requirements, making wavepacket-based studies of transport in many-body systems a promising application for near-term quantum computers.",

In this Letter, we introduce a stabilizer-based approach to construct analytically tractable energy eigenstates of nonintegrable many-body Hamiltonians. Focusing on zero-energy eigenstates at infinite temperature, we prove a sharp no-go theorem: stabilizer eigenstates of two-body Hamiltonians cannot satisfy $k$-body microscopic thermal equilibrium for any $k\\ge4$. We further show that this bound is tight by explicitly constructing two-body nonintegrable Hamiltonians whose stabilizer eigenstates reproduce thermal expectation values for all two-body and all three-body observables. Finally, we identify the structural origin of this limitation by characterizing the conditions under which a stabilizer state can appear as a zero-energy eigenstate of a Hamiltonian, thereby revealing a fundamental constraint imposed by the few-body nature of interactions.",

    "abstract": "At the heart of quark confinement and hadronization, the physics of flux strings has recently become a focal point in the field of quantum simulation of high-energy physics (HEP). Despite considerable progress, a detailed understanding of the behavior of flux strings in quantum simulation-relevant lattice formulations of gauge theories has remained limited to the lowest truncations of the gauge field, which are severely limited in their ability to draw conclusions about the quantum field theory limit. Here, we employ tensor network simulations to investigate the behavior of flux strings in a quantum link formulation of $2+1$D quantum electrodynamics (QED) with a spin-$1$ representation of the gauge field. We first map out the ground-state phase diagram of this model in the presence of two spatially separated static charges, revealing distinct microscopic processes responsible for string breaking, including a two-stage breaking mechanism not possible in the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. Starting in different initial product state string configurations, we then explore far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics across various parameter regimes, demonstrating genuine $2+1$D real-time string breaking and glueball-like bound state formation, with the latter not possible in the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. In and out of equilibrium, we consider different values and placements of the static charges. Finally, we provide efficient qudit circuits for a quantum simulation experiment in which our results can be observed in state-of-the-art ion-trap setups. Our findings lay the groundwork for quantum simulations of flux strings towards the quantum field theory limit.",

    "abstract": "Saturation of cumulative observables is widely observed in systems with propagating or spreading signals and is commonly modeled using system-specific mechanisms such as scattering statistics, coherence functions, or phenomenological decay laws. This work shows that such saturation follows directly from linear local relaxation alone. Any linear observable accumulated over the lifetime of a relaxing signal is bounded by a scale set by the relaxation time, independent of geometry, dimensionality, or microscopic dynamics. When relaxation is mapped to space through transport or spreading, this temporal bound yields a corresponding spatial saturation scale. A closed-form expression reveals a two-regime behavior: linear growth at short times followed by saturation beyond the relaxation time. The result provides a minimal and unified explanation for cumulative saturation across transport, diffusive, and stochastic systems.",

These systems are notoriously difficult to solve, even with state-of-the-art numerical methods, especially in regimes of parameters where degrees of freedom compete or cooperate at similar energy and length scales. Here, we introduce a spin-1 slave-particle technique to approximately treat the t-U-V-J fermionic model at arbitrary electron dopings in an economical manner. This formalism respectively maps the original charge and spin degrees of freedom into effective pseudo-spin and pseudo-fermion sectors, which are treated using a self-consistent cluster mean-field method. We study the phase diagram of the model under various conditions and report the appearance of charge and spin stripes within this formalism. These stripes are a consequence of the cluster mean-field treatment of the pseudo-particle sectors and have not been detected in previous slave-particle studies. The results obtained agree qualitatively well with what more reliable numerical methods capture.",

Numerical simulations show that, unlike standard QAOA, SBO-QAOA yields ground-state probabilities converging to finite-temperature values with uniform distribution among degenerate states.

Even though the other end is free, and hence can spin and release torsional stress, we observe that the entire chain transitions between a swollen and a plectonemic phase as the torque increases beyond a critical threshold. In the plectonemic phase, we observe a non-linear twist profile in the steady state, resulting from the mutual interconversion between the injected twist and geometrical writhe, which distributes inhomogeneously along the chain. We also show that the non-equilibrium dynamics of twist accumulation is diffusive, and that writhe diffusion is negligible in this geometry, as plectonemes remain localised near the end that is being rotated. We discuss the feasibility of testing our results with single-molecule experiments.",

To assess the equation's validity, it is common to assume that the system is ergodic and to verify that solutions approach correct equilibrium values at asymptotically long times. In this paper, we instead consider the consistency of the generalized Langevin equation with the Jarzynski equality at finite times and do not assume the system's ergodicity. Specifically, we consider a classical Brownian oscillator whose initial stiffness, or frequency, is perturbed by a rectangular pulse of duration $τ$. We find that the Jarzynski equality is satisfied unconditionally only up to the seventh order in $τ$; in higher orders, the Jarzynski equality holds if and only if the noise is Gaussian. These results imply that, unless it is exact, the Langevin equation can only be used to evaluate properties that are linear or quadratic in noise and its derivatives. Such properties are insensitive to the noise statistics, so the Langevin equation with linear dissipation and non-Gaussian noise (though not inconsistent by itself) is superfluous.",

For large systems and sampling times smaller than a critical value $τ_c = 2π/ΔE$, where $ΔE$ is the energy bandwidth, the splitting probability is universal and equal to $1/2$, independent of the initial condition and the sampling time. Above the critical sampling, a nonuniversal regime emerges in which the splitting probability deviates from $1/2$ and develops a fluctuating pattern of pronounced peaks and dips dependent on both the sampling time and the initial condition.

Among these, biexcitons -- bound states of two electrons and two holes -- provide a sensitive probe of Coulomb correlations, exciton-exciton interactions, and the role of the dielectric environment. In Ruddlesden-Popper metal halide materials (RPMHs), strong quantum and dielectric confinement stabilize excitons with binding energies of hundreds of meV, creating an ideal platform for multi-exciton phenomena. Conventional linear spectroscopies, such as photoluminescence and transient absorption, reveal biexciton signatures but suffer from spectral congestion and reabsorption artifacts. Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopies, particularly two-quantum (2Q) multidimensional techniques, uniquely access multi-exciton coherences and provide unambiguous estimates of biexciton binding energies. This minireview surveys the spectroscopic evidence for biexcitons in RPMHs, highlights the advantages of nonlinear multidimensional approaches, and situates biexciton physics within the broader context of excitonic materials, including GaAs quantum wells, quantum dots, and transition-metal dichalcogenides. By emphasizing the interplay of exciton-exciton annihilation, excitation-induced dephasing, and biexciton formation, we argue that multidimensional coherent spectroscopy offers the most reliable pathway to disentangle many-body interactions in quantum-well derivatives of metal-halide perovskites.",

In this study, we report the epitaxial synthesis of novel room-temperature ferromagnetic insulating thin films, achieved through the precise construction of (111)-oriented 3d/5d interfaces. Our analysis indicates that, unlike conventional doping methods, the (111)-oriented SrIrO3/La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (SIO/LSMO) interfaces exhibit markedly enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This enhanced interfacial SOC strengthens the electron-phonon coupling in LSMO, thereby shortening the electronic mean free path. As a result, the intrinsic metallicity of LSMO is suppressed, giving rise to a new FMI phase that emerges between the ferromagnetic metal and paramagnetic insulator regimes of the LSMO phase diagram. Furthermore, the temperature window of the FMI state can be tuned by precisely controlling the thickness of the LSMO layers. Our study reveals a new strategy for developing ferromagnetic insulators by engineering 3d/5d interfaces and orientations, paving a way for the development of novel dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices.",

The introduction of Nb$^{5+}$ at the V$^{5+}$ site leads to notable structural and vibrational changes, which can be attributed to their isoelectronic nature and the comparatively larger ionic radius of Nb$^{5+}$. The Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction patterns confirms a coexistence of monoclinic ($P$2$_{1}$/$n$) and scheelite-type tetragonal ($I$4$_{1}$/$a$) phases; for example, with a fraction of 4\\% and 96\\% for the sample annealed at 1250\\degree C. The particle morphology has altered from spherical (1000\\degree C) to irregular-shaped (1250\\degree C) as a result of increase in annealing temperature. The Raman spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy have been used to understand the vibrational and electronic properties. An optical band gap of 2.7~eV for the sample sintered at 1250\\degree C is calculated using Ultraviolet-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements. The dielectric studies shows the higher dielectric permittivity ($ε$$_{r}$) and lower dielectric loss for the sample annealed at 1250\\degree C.",

    "abstract": "Combinatorial sputtering is a physical vapor deposition method that enables the high-throughput synthesis of compositionally varied thin films. Using this technique, the effects of stoichiometry on specific properties of alloy thin films with analog composition gradients can be mapped using high-throughput characterization. To obtain specific stoichiometries, such as those desired for an equiatomic, intermetallic, or doped compounds, the sputter power of each target must be simultaneously tuned to optimize the deposition rate of each component. This optimization problem increases in complexity with the number of components, which commonly leads to iterative guess-and-check processing and can limit the intrinsic high-throughput advantages of this synthesis method. To circumvent this challenge, this work introduces a composition optimization procedure that enables the facile synthesis of sputtered combinatorial films with targeted compositions. This procedure leverages the expeditious mapping of composition using wavelength dispersive x-ray fluorescence and is capable of optimizing processing for an arbitrary number of components. As a demonstration, this method is leveraged to sputter a combinatorial Cr$_{v}$Fe$_{w}$Mo$_{x}$Nb$_{y}$Ta$_{z}$ film with an equiatomic composition near the wafer center.",

    "abstract": "The magnons in antiferromagnetic insulators (AFIs) exhibit dual chirality, each carrying opposite spin angular momentum. However, in AFIs that are protected by PT symmetry, the magnon bands remain degenerate. In this work, we introduce a new class of PT - preserving AFIs in which the giant chiral splitting of magnons can be induced and reversibly controlled by an external electric field. Unlike ordinary cases, such AFIs host a hidden dipole coupled to the antiferromagnetic order, which allows an external electric field to break the magnon sublattice symmetry and thereby largely lift the band degeneracy. Through group theory analysis, we identify the possible magnetic layer groups that support electric-field-induced magnon band splitting. Promisingly, by density-functional- theory and spin wave calculations, the magnon band splitting of Cr2CBr2 reach up to 27meV induced by an electric field of 0.2V/Å, equivalent to the 230T under a uniform magnetic field. In addition, since chiral splitting is directly coupled to the electric field, the corresponding magnon-mediated spin current can be switched by the electric field. Our Letter opens a door for developing electric-field-controlled spintronics based on the magnons.",

Whenever one of the particles is absorbed, it is replaced by a new particle at the position of one of the $N-1$ remaining particles. Here we consider the case where the particles lie on the semi-infinite line with a biased diffusion towards the origin which is the absorbing site. In the large $N$ limit, the evolution of the density becomes deterministic and has a number of characteristics similar to the Fisher-KPP equation: a one-parameter family of steady state solutions, dependence of the long time asymptotics on the initial conditions, Bramson logarithmic shift, etc. One noticeable difference, however, is that in the Fleming-Viot case, the solution can be computed explicitly for arbitrary initial conditions and at an arbitrary time. By modifying the diffusion rule near the origin, one can produce a transition in the flux of absorbed particles, very similar to the pushed-pulled transition in travelling waves. Lastly, using a cut-off approximation (which is known to be correct in the theory of travelling waves), we derive a number of predictions for the leading large $N$ correction of the flux of absorbed particles.",

(Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 119, e2207449119 (2022)). These observations were interpreted as evidence for a direct link between superconductivity and the charge-transfer gap, and more broadly revived the long-standing question of the role of apical oxygens in cuprate superconductivity. Using a combination of density-functional theory and cluster dynamical mean-field theory, we compute from first principles the variations of $m_{\\mathrm{SC}}$ induced solely by apical oxygen displacement in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CuO$_{6+δ}$, Bi-2212, and HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+δ}$. The quantitative agreement between our calculations and experiments allows us to unambiguously attribute the observed variations of $m_{\\mathrm{SC}}$ to changes in $δ_{\\mathrm{api}}$. We demonstrate, however, that these variations of $m_{\\mathrm{SC}}$ originate predominantly from changes in the effective hole-doping of the CuO$_2$ planes, with negligible effect on the charge-transfer gap. The modest magnitude of the $m_{\\mathrm{SC}}$ modulation induced by apical-oxygen displacement alone therefore warrants caution in interpreting correlations between $T_c$ and $δ_{\\mathrm{api}}$ inferred from comparisons across different cuprate compounds.",

Mutual screening between the layers reduces scattering from random Coulomb potentials, resulting in a quantum mobility exceeding. Shubnikov de-Haas oscillations emerge at magnetic fields below 1 mT, while integer quantum Hall features are observed at 0.002T. Furthermore, we identify a fractional quantum Hall plateau at a filling factor of at 2T.

    "abstract": "Fingerprint labyrinthine patterns exhibit a level of structural complexity beyond simple stripe phases, combining local stripe order with a dense network of point-like defects. Unlike symmetry-breaking phases, where coarsening proceeds via diffusive defect annihilation, or conventional stripe phases, where curvature-driven motion of extended grain boundaries dominates, the coarsening of fingerprint labyrinths is governed primarily by localized junction and terminal defects. Using the Turing-Swift-Hohenberg equation, we study the nonequilibrium relaxation of fingerprint labyrinthine patterns following a quench. To go beyond conventional Fourier-based diagnostics, we employ a template-matching convolutional neural network (TM-CNN) to identify and track junctions and terminals directly in real space, enabling a quantitative characterization of defect statistics and spatial correlations. We show that, although these point-like defects drive coarsening, their motion is strongly constrained by the surrounding stripe geometry, leading to slow, nondiffusive dynamics that are qualitatively distinct from both conventional phase ordering and stripe coarsening. Together, these results establish defect-mediated dynamics as the central organizing principle of fingerprint labyrinthine coarsening and demonstrate the effectiveness of machine-learning-assisted approaches for complex pattern-forming systems.",

    "abstract": "We present a theoretical framework for non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin torque oscillators (NC-AFM STO) by unifying spin dynamics under the Poisson Bracket formalism. Shifting from traditional torque-based descriptions to an operational symmetry perspective, we develop two complementary viewpoints: a vector perspective identifying infinite degenerate Rigid Body Precession (RBP) states where exchange energy depends solely on the total magnetic momentum, and a particle perspective decomposing dynamics into Center-of-Mass (CM) translation and Relative Motion (RM) oscillation. Using time-dependent rotational and translational transformation techniques, we analytically resolve the rapid (~10 ps) transient evolution into a stable RBP state driven by SOT and damping. We demonstrate that the out-of-plane anisotropy (OPA) lifts the exchange degeneracy, triggering a long-term (~1 ns) oscillatory decay toward a steady state characterized by uniform spin z-components and a 120-degree inter-spin locking angle. This state is accurately governed by our Terminal Velocity Motion (TVM) model [arXiv:2305.14013], where exchange coupling transforms into kinetic energy with a light effective mass. The model precisely predicts SOT-driven transients, hysteretic excitation, and the dynamic phase diagram. Finally, we account for the sub-critical current regime mismatch by identifying a 'Rigid-Body Breaking' effect: a surge in effective friction caused by the self-resonance of RM variables induced by CM translation, mediated by the in-plane anisotropy (IPA).",

Frictional work then quantifies the difference in work output between adiabatic and non-adiabatic driving. Here we show that frictional work in a non-integrable spin chain is well-described by the diagonal entropy production associated with the build up of quantum coherence. The relationship is characterized by an effective temperature of the final adiabatic state and holds for slow to moderate driving protocols. For fast protocols, the frictional work is instead described by the quantum relative entropy between the final non-adiabatic and adiabatic states. We compare our results to those obtained from an integrable spin chain, in which case the adiabatic state is no longer described by a single temperature. In this case, the frictional work is described by a sum of terms for each independent subspace of the spin chain, which are at different effective temperatures. We show how integrability breaking can enhance work extraction in the adiabatic limit, but degrade work extraction in sufficiently non-adiabatic regimes.",

In this context, brain-inspired neuromorphic computing, which integrate data storage and processing, has attracted significant attention. Here, our study reveals that field effect transistors fabricated on chemical vapor deposited bilayer (2L) MoS2 films can mimic the functions of biological synapse. These devices demonstrate high level of pair pulse facilitation (PPF), short term to long term memory (STM-to-LTM) transition as well as learning-forgetting-relearning properties. Effect of light intensity, pulse number, pulse width and photon energy on the STM-to-LTM transition is studied. It has been found that the rate of depression of the memory state can be controlled using the gate bias. Electrical and optical energy consumptions per synaptic event are estimated to be as low as 280 fJ and 20 nJ, respectively. Furthermore, photocurrent in these devices is observed to increase linearly with the number of the excitation pulses. This property has been exploited to demonstrate different arithmetic operations by the device. Moreover, these devices show great potential for image recognition. Artificial neural network simulation has returned an image recognition accuracy of ~85%. All these findings show a great prospect of 2L-MoS2 for developing low power, transparent and flexible neuromorphic devices.",

While CrSb hosts Weyl fermions at equilibrium, modest tensile strain of 4-5% stabilizes additional symmetry allowed Dirac crossings and triple-point fermions, with further strain selectively favoring the triple-point phase. We propose a 3D low-energy Hamiltonian that captures the interplay between the Hubbard interaction $U$ and the sublattice symmetry of the altermagnet, giving rise to an interaction-driven Dirac crossing.

Each filament is assumed Hookean initially, then breaks irreversibly above a threshold strain. At early times after the imposition of a small stress, we find purely viscoelastic creep response associated with non-affine deformations within the material, with solid terminal behaviour for a network coordination $Z>2d=4$ and initially floppy response for $Z<4$. For a marginally connected network, $Z=4$, we find sustained power law creep with a strain rate $\\dotγ\\sim t^{-1/2}$ and strain $γ\\sim t^{1/2}$ as a function of time $t$ after the imposition of the stress. This viscoelastic regime gives way at later times to irreversible elastoplastic creep arising from filament breakage, broadening the range of values of $Z$ and time over which power law creep occurs, compared to a network with filament breakage disallowed. This accumulating damage can weaken the network to such an extent that catastrophic material failure then occurs after a long delay, which we characterise. Finally, we consider the implications of viscoelastic versus elastoplastic deformation for the extent to which a material will recover its original shape if the load is removed after some interval of creep.",

    "abstract": "Topological semimetals are renowned for exhibiting large, unsaturated magnetoresistance arising from ultrahigh carrier mobility and electron-hole compensation. However, such behaviors remain poorly understood in iron-based superconductors that have been recently recognized to harbor rich nontrivial topology. Here, we combine angle-resolved magneto-transport measurements with first principles calculations to reveal the emergence and tunability of topological semimetals in ferropnictide Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_{2+δ}As$_2$ epitaxial films, modulated by interstitial Fe. These states exhibit ultralow residual resistivity, coexisting high-mobility electron and hole carriers, and linear positive magnetoresistance below 110 K. Remarkably, the magnetoresistance becomes more pronounced when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the film plane, reaching an unsaturated 1206% at 56 T. Furthermore, superconductivity persists in these ferropnictide films, establishing them as a tunable platform for investigating the interplay among electron correlation, topology, and superconductivity.",

    "title": "Intertwined Charge Stripes and Majorana Zero Modes in An Iron-Based Superconductor",
    "abstract": "In type-II superconductors, magnetic fields modulate the amplitude and phase of the superconducting order parameter, forming quantized vortices where superconductivity is locally suppressed and exotic bound states or competing electronic orders emerge. Using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy on epitaxial Ba(Fe$_{0.94}Co$_{0.06})$_2$As$_2$ films, we discover an incommensurate charge-stripe order aligned with the Fe-Fe bond direction and nucleated inside magnetic vortices. These charge modulations intensify at the vortex core, extend far into the vortex halo, and persist within the superconducting gap. Strikingly, the charge order modulates Andreev bound states of vortices at non-zero energies, producing abelian vortices with half-odd-integer level quantization and non-abelian vortices with integer-quantized core states that host a Majorana zero mode. The distinct vortex types are distinguished by the registry of their centers relative to the charge-stripe pattern and remain robust in ultrathin (2.5-unit-cell) films. Our findings reveal a density-wave-textured vortex matter and provide fresh insights into the intertwined phenomena of charge-stripe order, pair-density-wave modulations, and Majorana physics in iron-based superconductors.",

    "abstract": "A polymorph of the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 that displays an alternating single-layer (SL) and trilayer (TL; 1313) stacking pattern has recently been discovered. Signatures of superconductivity under pressure have been found in this phase. At ambient pressure, La3Ni2O7-1313 has been reported to crystallize in three different space-group symmetries Cmmm, Imma, and Fmmm. Unlike the commonly observed tilted NiO6 octahedra in perovskite nickelates, the Cmmm phase exhibits no NiO6 tilts, implying that this structural feature alone may be insufficient to give rise to superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates. Here, we employ first-principles calculations and group theory analysis to study the pressure dependence of the structural instabilities in this SL-TL La3Ni2O7 polymorph. At ambient pressure, we identify multiple unstable phonon branches in the highest symmetry (Cmmm) structure at various high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. Distortions associated with these instabilities lead to one of the other experimentally reported space groups (Imma) that does display octahedral tilts. The magnetic tendencies indicate that the electronic structure of La3Ni2O7-1313 at ambient pressure is dominated by the TL block, as the SL is in a Mott-insulating regime. Under pressure, a tetragonal P4/mmm structure becomes stable, in agreement with experiments.",

This study mainly focused on the investigation of the morphological and structural evolution of the film surface after various external stimuli designed to provide energy to the system. For film growth, we adopted an innovative approach, combining ion-beam sputtering of a pure metal target with thermal evaporation of C60 in a co-deposition setup. The films underwent a series of treatments to induce modifications. Laser and ion irradiations were performed using a pulsed laser, a continuous Ar beam, and a pulsed C beam. In addition, thermal annealing in vacuum was performed to examine the long-term effects of temperature. The composition of deposited film was investigated using Ion Beam Analysis, the morphology and the structure, and the effects of treatments on the films were studied using SEM and TEM microscopies and Raman spectroscopy. Changes in electrical resistance were also measured to explore potential applications of these films after treatment.",

    "title": "Localized emission in MoSe$_2$ monolayers on GaN nanopillars",
    "abstract": "Solid-state quantum emitters (QEs) in two-dimensional semiconductors offer compact, chip-compatible sources for quantum photonics. In transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), nanopillars are widely used to induce localized emission, yet the underlying confinement mechanism and the relative roles of strain versus dielectric environment remain unclear. The general problem addressed here is whether strain alone explains quantum emitter formation and placement in MoSe$_2$, or whether dielectric contrast at suspended-supported interfaces is also required. Here, we combine hyperspectral superlocalization of photoluminescence with co-registered AFM topography and phase to map the positions of localized states (LS) in MoSe$_2$ suspended on GaN pillars and correlate them with bending strain and the local dielectric context. Contrary to the common assumption of purely strain-driven activation, LS frequently occur at suspended--supported interfaces around the pillar apex and span a broad strain range without a clear threshold, while being scarce along high-strain ripples. Our data indicate that deterministic emitter positioning in Mo-based TMDs benefits from co-engineering both strain gradients and nanoscale dielectric heterogeneity, rather than strain alone. More broadly, this combined optical-mechanical characterization approach provides a general framework for mapping structure-property relationships in 2D quantum materials at the single-emitter level.",

    "abstract": "Solid electrolytes (SEs) for sodium-based superionic conductors (NaSICON) are widely recognized for their excellent ionic conductivity and application in sodium based energy storage systems. While considerable effort has been made to develop thin electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) for lithium ions, only a few sodium-based SEs have been successfully fabricated as thin films. These thin films are particularly desirable for their reduced electrical resistance, which typically increases with the thickness of the SE. By reducing the thickness of the SEs to the nanometer scale, their ionic conductivity can be significantly enhanced. In this study, the NASICON composite was initially prepared in the form of pellets using the mixed oxide technique with a planetary ball mill and synthesized by the solid-state method at 1250 °C. The resulting pellets were used as sputtering targets in a low-energy ion facility to prepare continuous and uniform NASICON nanofilms. To explore the effect of ion implantation on the electrical properties of NASICON, the prepared films were bombarded with Ni ions at 1.1 MeV and varying fluences, using the Tandetron accelerator at the CANAM infrastructure (NPI Řež). The electrical properties of both the synthesized and implanted films were analyzed through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results, describing the impact of irradiation on NASICON's properties, are presented here.",

    "abstract": "We study a quasi-one-dimensional fluid of hard dumbbells with continuous orientational degrees of freedom using an exact transfer-matrix formulation. The model allows for a complete analytical characterization of thermodynamic properties, orientational ordering, and correlation functions in terms of the spectral properties of an integral operator. We derive exact expressions for the equation of state, the orientational distribution function, and both partial and total radial distribution functions. Their asymptotic behavior is governed by the complex poles of the Laplace-transformed correlation functions, which determine the positional and orientational correlation lengths. As density increases, the system exhibits a continuous crossover from a weakly ordered regime with a unimodal orientational distribution to a strongly constrained regime characterized by bimodal orientational ordering. This crossover is accompanied by a nonmonotonic behavior of the pressure relative to the Tonks gas and by a qualitative change in the decay of correlation functions from oscillatory to monotonic. In the high-pressure limit, we show that orientational and positional fluctuations contribute equally to the pressure, leading to a universal ratio of twice the Tonks pressure. The theoretical predictions are supported by numerical solutions of the discretized transfer operator and by scaling arguments that elucidate the high-pressure behavior of ordering and correlation lengths.",

Ultrasonic methods are suitable for experimental investigations of these phenomena. We investigate elastic constants in EuAl$_{12}$O$_{19}$, a quasi-two-dimensional anisotropic ferromagnet, by measuring sound velocity in magnetic fields perpendicular to spontaneous magnetization. The shear modulus $C_{44}$ exhibits dramatic softening at the field-induced transition from the ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic phase with magnetic moments forced to polarize along the applied transverse field. The softening is attributed to strong magnetic fluctuations near a second-order phase transition. Theoretical calculations based on magnetization data qualitatively reproduced the observed behavior within a strain-exchange mechanism. These results demonstrate that magnetoelastic coupling in EuAl$_{12}$O$_{19}$ arises primarily from exchange striction and provide a framework for modeling similar transitions in other anisotropic ferromagnets.",

    "abstract": "Mixed ionic electronic transfer (MIET) reactions, such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at oxide surfaces, are of paramount importance to manifold technologically highly relevant processes and fundamental understanding must be developed to improve performance and tailor highly efficient electrodes and catalysts. Understanding such complex multi-step reactions, requires the study of kinetic processes, underlying thermodynamic properties, i.e. ionic and electronic defect concentrations and electrostatic surface effects. However conventional techniques struggle to uncover the complete picture within the same sample/measurement. Here, we overcome this limitation by introducing bias-triggered conductivity relaxation (BCR) as a novel tool to investigate MIET reactions on oxides. It is based on alternating out-of-plane coulometric titration/polarization and in-plane electrical conductivity relaxation measurements, providing simultaneous electronic, ionic and extraordinarily rich surface kinetics information. This innovative combination of electrical and chemical driving forces synergizes information depth, with enhanced time resolution, versatility and speed, yet it lifts the weaknesses of the individual approaches, while remaining cost-effective and surprisingly simple. Furthermore, BCR allows to disentangle overpotential induced electrostatic modifications of the surface kinetics in a unique manner. We showcase the advantages of BCR in this work by studying the ORR in model (La,Sr)FeO$_{3-δ}$ thin film electrodes and reporting on their thermodynamic and kinetic properties.",

    "abstract": "Mobility edges commonly arise in one-dimensional quasiperiodic systems once exact self-duality is broken, yet their origin is typically understood only at the level of individual Hamiltonians. Here we show that mobility edge positions are not independent spectral features of individual Hamiltonians, but are structurally constrained across quasiperiodic Hamiltonians related by an isospectral duality. Using a bichromatic Aubry--André model as a minimal setting, we demonstrate that this constraint is encoded in an exact identity for Lyapunov exponents derived from the Thouless formula. As a consequence, the mobility edge positions are restricted to a reduced set of energies. In the self-dual limit, these mobility edge positions coincide at a single localization--delocalization transition. This structural constraint enforces a linear critical scaling of the physical Lyapunov spectrum near the self-dual point. Numerical results confirm a critical exponent consistent with the standard Aubry--André value of $ν= 1$, while simultaneously revealing a novel, non-universal energy-dependent prefactor.",

Since the features of mesoscopic fluctuations are essentially different from those of the surrounding matter, they can be interpreted as fluctuations of one phase occurring inside another host phase. In condensed matter, these fluctuations are of nanosize. They can occur in many-body systems of different nature, for instance, they are typical for condensed matter, can appear in systems of trapped atoms, and also arise in biological and social systems. A survey of the experimental evidence for the occurrence of mesoscopic fluctuations in different materials and systems is given.

Control over this degree of freedom can be achieved through simple calibration for each specific material system, via either mechanical experiments or numerical simulations. This reduction allows us to inverse-design a woven smart fabric, that conforms to an arbitrary target geometry when actuated, by solving a nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equation. We validate this approach by deriving the thread-level actuation required for specific target geometries. We present both exact analytic solutions for symmetric shapes and a numerical optimization method for arbitrary freeform surfaces. These results confirm the practicality of our framework in achieving programmable, complex three-dimensional shaping.",

Many of the technologies investigated so far aim at producing composite materials associating graphene or GRMs with either metal or semiconducting nanocrystals or other carbon nanostructures (e.g., CNT, graphite). These composites can be used favourably as hydrogen storage materials or solar cell absorbers. They can also provide better performing electrodes for fuel cells, batteries, or supercapacitors. For photovoltaic (PV) electrodes, where thin layers and interface engineering are required, surface technologies are preferred. We are using conventional vacuum processes to integrate graphene as well as radically new approaches based on laser irradiation strategies. For each application, the potential of implemented technologies is then presented on the basis of selected experimental and modelling results. It is shown in particular how some of these technologies can maximize the benefit taken from GRM integration.

Materealize provides two complementary modes. In instant mode, the system rapidly composes connected tools to solve diverse inorganic tasks-including property-conditioned synthesizable candidate design with synthesis recipes, diagnosis, and redesign of unsynthesizable structures, and synthesizable data augmentation-within a few minutes. In thinking mode, Materealize applies multi-agent debate to deliver more refined and information-rich synthesis recommendations, including reasoning- and model-driven synthesis routes and mechanistic hypotheses. The mechanistic hypotheses are validated by direct comparison with the literature for known mechanisms and further supported by physics-grounded simulations for novel synthesis pathways. By combining tool-level accuracy with reasoning-level integration, Materealize can bridge the gap between computational discovery and practical experimental realization.",

    "title": "Permanent Lattice Compression of Lead-Halide Perovskite for Persistently Enhanced Optoelectronic Properties",
    "abstract": "Under mild mechanical pressure, halide perovskites show enhanced optoelectronic properties. However, these improvements are reversible upon decompression, and permanent enhancements have yet to be realized. Here, we report antisolvent-assisted solvent acidolysis crystallization that enables us to prepare methylammonium lead bromide single crystals showing intense emission at all four edges under ultraviolet light excitation. We study structural variations, edge-vs-center, in these crystals using micro-X-ray diffraction and find that the enhanced emission at the edges correlates with lattice compression compared to in the central areas. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements show much longer-lived photogenerated carriers at the compressed edges, with radiative component lifetimes of ca. 1.4 us, 10 times longer than at the central regions. The properties of the edges are exploited to fabricate planar photodetectors exhibiting detectivities of 3x10^13 Jones, compared to 5x10^12 Jones at the central regions. The enhanced lifetimes and detectivities correlate to the reduced trap state densities and the formation of shallower traps at the edges due to lattice compression.",

    "title": "Systematic Magnetic Structure Generation Based on Oriented Spin Space Groups: Formulation, Applications, and High-Throughput First-Principles Calculations",
    "abstract": "We propose a framework for generating magnetic structures, inspired by the concept of oriented spin space groups (SSGs): magnetic structures are first generated as totally symmetric representations of an SSG and are then rotated such that they belong to the maximal magnetic space group of the SSG, which we term spin-symmetry-adapted (SSA) structures and oriented SSA structures, respectively. This is a natural framework to enforce fixed magnetic moment magnitudes on the symmetry-equivalent sites as well as to exploit the spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-induced hierarchy of energy scales. To examine the present scheme, we analyze the MAGNDATA database and find that 77% of the reported structures are reproducible at the SSG level, among which 82% are fully reproduced within the oriented SSG scheme, regardless of their spin-only group types or propagation vectors. To quantitatively assess computational and predictive performance, we perform spin density functional theory calculations for 283 materials, first carrying out self-consistent calculations for SSA structures without SOC, followed by fixed-charge calculations including SOC for the descendant oriented SSA structures. The experimental magnetic structures are reproduced as energetically most stable in 82% of cases at the SSG level without SOC and in 76% of cases at the oriented SSG level with SOC, showing that the fixed-charge scheme enables accurate evaluation of SOC-induced energy differences at low computational cost. The characteristic energy scale among oriented SSA structures is only $\\sim$0.29 meV per magnetic atom, about 300 times smaller than that of distinct SSA structures. These results demonstrate that oriented SSG-based enumeration, combined with the two-step calculations for SSA and oriented SSA structures, provides an efficient and robust route for large-scale magnetic-structure prediction.",

    "abstract": "Grain boundary (GB) migration accompanied by Cr depletion is widely observed in Alloy 690 and is closely linked to intergranular degradation and stress corrosion cracking. However, the fundamental driving force for GB migration and its link with Cr depletion remains unclear. In this work, hybrid molecular dynamics and semi-grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations were employed to investigate GB migration in Alloy 690 under coupled solute diffusion and segregation effects across a range of GB characters. The results show that Cr segregation at GBs, while generally considered favorable for GB stability, can facilitate diffusion-induced GB migration and Cr depletion. Cr diffusion along GBs produces localized Cr depletion zones that are energetically incompatible with positively segregating GBs, generating a chemical driving force that drives GB migration toward the Cr-rich matrix, which ultimately results in persistent GB migration accompanied by a Cr depletion. By quantifying solute-GB interaction energetics, we demonstrate that GB migration is quantitively controlled by the coupled effects of solute diffusivity and segregation strength. These mechanistic insights provide a unified framework that rationalizes experimentally observed correlations between GB character, Cr depletion, and GB migration in Cr-containing alloys.",

    "abstract": "Vapor deposited two-dimensional Cr$_{7}$Te$_{8}$ displays unusual temperature dependent Hall effect properties, including a room temperature anomalous Hall effect, sign reversals of the Hall resistivity on cooling, and a peak in the Hall resistivity at low temperatures. The two dimensional Cr$_{7}$Te$_{8}$ heterostructures that form the basis of these measurements are hexagonal in structure. We study the magnetic and structural properties of bulk Cr$_{7}$Te$_{8}$ synthesized by quenching from 1000 $^{\\circ}$C with the goal of relating the magnetic, structural, and electronic properties. This quenched phase is metastable, hexagonal, and displays different magnetic properties from the slow-cooled and more thermodynamically stable monoclinic phase. High-resolution x-ray diffraction of the quenched hexagonal phase finds a first-order transition to a lower symmetry monoclinic phase on \\textit{heating} above $\\sim$ 550 K. Magnetic susceptibility measurements of the quenched hexagonal phase reveal ferromagnetic ordering above room temperature, along with the two distinct transitions at $\\sim$ 220~K and $\\sim$ 70~K. Through neutron diffraction studies, we find the $\\sim$ 220 K anomaly is a spin reorientation transition of the ferromagnetically aligned magnetic moments and the $\\sim70$ K feature represents a transition from a high temperature ferromagnet to a low temperature antiferromagnet. We suggest that these magnetic transitions are related to changes in the unit cell dimensions and are connected to the temperature dependent Hall resisitivity studied in two-dimensional heterostructures. This implies a link between structural, magnetic, and electronic properties in the ``pseudo\" two-dimensional chromium tellurides.",

    "abstract": "The slip behavior of dislocations and grain boundaries critically governs recrystallization and plastic deformation in Mg alloys and can be strongly influenced by solutes. However, the quantitative effects of solute distribution on defect mobility remain unclear. Using molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, we systematically investigate how Al and Ca solutes affect the motion of dislocations, low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs), and high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) in Mg. Within the idealized framework of random solid-solution, solute drag is dominated by elastic interactions arising from atomic size mismatch, resulting in a stronger resistance from Ca than from Al. In contrast, under the more realistic condition where solute segregation occurs, the dominant mechanism shifts to chemically driven pinning, whose effectiveness is governed by the attainable segregation density. Owing to strong Ca-Ca repulsion, Al achieves substantially higher segregation concentrations than Ca and therefore exerts much stronger pinning effects. Notably, solute-induced retardation is significantly more pronounced for HAGBs than for LAGBs, leading to amplified solute effects during the late stages of recrystallization, where grain growth is controlled primarily by HAGB migration. These results provide atomic-scale insight into experimentally observed grain refinement in Mg alloys.",

The Ge hut nanowires are grown on prepatterned SiGe ridges via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and Josephson junction devices are fabricated by contacting the nanowires with Al electrodes. Low-temperature current-bias transport measurements of the Josephson junctions are performed and the measurements show that the devices exhibit gate-tunable supercurrent and excess current. The analysis of excess current indicates that the transparency of the Ge hut nanowire Josephson junctions is as high as 85%. Voltage-bias spectroscopy measurements of the devices show multiple Andreev reflections up to the fourth order. With magnetic field and temperature-dependent measurements of the multiple Andreev reflections, the critical field and the critical temperature of the induced superconductivity in the Josephson junctions are extracted to be ~0.12 T and ~1.4 K. The success in introducing superconductivity into Ge hut nanowires will stimulate their applications in building advanced quantum processors.",

    "abstract": "Quantum interference effects such as weak localization (WL) and universal conductance fluctuations (UCF) normally yield consistent electronic phase-coherence lengths in homogeneous conductors. Here we show that in individual carbon nanotube bundles exfoliated from highly conductive solution-spun fibers, different probes, including the field scales and magnitudes of WL and UCF and nonlocal magnetoconductance, lead to strikingly disparate estimates of coherence lengths. WL magnetoconductance measured in a perpendicular magnetic field yields a phase-coherence length of approximately 50 nm. In contrast, UCF amplitudes are comparable to e squared over h even for an 8 micrometer long segment, and nonlocal magnetoconductance persists across a 4 micrometer separation of electrodes, revealing phase-coherent transport over micrometer length scales within a single bundle. The coexistence of short- and long-range coherence implies that locally diffusive electrons remain partially phase-correlated among nanotubes within the same bundle. These findings challenge the conventional single-scale picture of mesoscopic coherence and establish carbon nanotube bundles as a model platform for emergent, network-level quantum transport.",

We found that the superconducting-gap spectrum exhibits intricate structures reflecting the anisotropic gaps opening on multiple Fermi surfaces. Notably, none of the characteristic energy scales apparent in the spectral gap show appreciable spatial variations, suggesting that the finite-momentum pairing is negligible. Instead, the spectral weight near the coherence peak is modulated with the same periodicity as the CDW. The maximum position of the coherence-peak-weight modulation coincides with neither the peak nor the bottom of the CDW modulation; rather, it aligns with the center of one of the two inequivalent triangular plaquettes that comprise the CDW unit cell. This distribution pattern of Bogoliubov quasiparticles directly results from the broken in-plane inversion symmetry at the surface of 2H-NbSe2, which may activate Ising spin-orbit coupling.",

    "abstract": "The ab-initio thermodynamic properties of simple cubic polonium (α-Po) were studied within the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA), where both lattice vibrations (phonons) and electronic excitations contributions are included in the Helmholtz free energy. We investigate the influence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) by comparing the scalar relativistic (SR) and fully relativistic (FR) pseudopotentials on the thermodynamic properties of polonium and evaluate the performance of three popular exchange-correlation functionals, GGA (PBE and PBEsol), and LDA (PZ). Temperature and pressure-dependent thermodynamic properties were compared with the available experimental and theoretical studies. We found that the effect of electronic excitations is negligible for all the thermodynamic properties. LDA+SOC provides a better agreement with the experimental volume, while the thermal expansion coefficients from LDA+SOC and PBEsol + SOC closely match experimental values. SOC effects appear insignificant for the isobaric heat capacity but substantially contribute to the adiabatic bulk modulus. The phonon dispersions and mode-Grüneisen parameters (γ_qη) were interpolated at the lattice constant corresponding to 301 K. The SR dispersions exhibit several anomalies in all directions, which were suppressed significantly by the inclusion of SOC. The role of SOC on the elastic constant-coefficient (C_ij) and elastic anisotropy factor at 0 K is also studied. The Pugh ratio confirmed that simple cubic polonium is ductile, and we observed that the elastic anisotropy factor and Pugh ratio decreased with increasing pressure. The effect of SOC on the Cauchy pressure is also determined.",

First, we analyze a small network of Ising spins embedded in a large dissipative bath, modeled via the Lindblad master equation, where temperature arises naturally from system-bath coupling. This approach reveals how network topology shapes quantum dissipative dynamics, providing a basis for controlling quantum coherence through tailored network structures. Second, we propose a mean-field approach that extends the network to larger scales and captures dissipative dynamics in large-scale networks, connecting network topology to quantum coherence in complex systems and revealing the sensitivity of quantum coherence to network structure. Our results highlight how dissipative quantum dynamics depend on network topology, providing insight into the coherent dynamics of entangled states in networks. These results may be extended to dynamics in complex systems such as opinion propagation in social models, epidemiology, and various condensed-phase and biological systems.",

Mg incorporation is modeled up to 25% of Ga sites within supercells derived from fully relaxed unit cells of each polymorph. Our results show that while $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ remains the thermodynamically most stable phase, the enthalpic differences between polymorphs decrease with increasing Mg content. The inherently disordered $γ$ phase, with its high configurational entropy, becomes less energetically unfavorable under Mg substitution, suggesting that entropy-driven stabilization may facilitate its formation under high-temperature and/or nonequilibrium growth conditions such as those previously reported.

Here we focus on the Sc$_{6}$MTe$_{2}$ family (M =d-electron metal), which provides a unique platform of isostructural compounds exhibiting superconductivity across 3d, 4d, and 5d systems. Using hydrostatic pressure as an additional tuning parameter, muon-spin rotation ($μ$SR) and AC susceptibility measurements uncover strongly contrasting pressure responses of superconductivity across the Sc$_{6}$MTe$_{2}$ series. The superconducting transition temperature, $T_{\\rm C}$ decreases under pressure in the 3d Fe-based compound but increases for the 4d Ru- and 5d Ir-based systems, with the Ru compound showing the largest enhancement of nearly 50% within 2 GPa. The superfluid density exhibits similarly distinct pressure dependences, remaining nearly pressure independent for Fe while decreasing with increasing pressure for Ru and Ir. This suggests fundamentally different correlations between $T_{\\rm C}$ and the superfluid density. Together, these results indicate that superconductivity emerging from strongly correlated and spin-orbit-dominated regimes in Sc$_{6}$MTe$_{2}$ is likely governed by different microscopic mechanisms and offer a useful experimental basis for future microscopic theoretical studies.",

In particular, we prove that the topological stability of interface modes is invariant under flux attachment. We compare next-generation paired states to Bonderson-Slingerland states at the same filling factors, and demonstrate that their quasiparticles carry identical charges and obey the same exchange statistics. The next-generation and Bonderson-Slingerland states still describe distinct phases, and we find that the former are energetically favored in the lowest Landau level, while the latter are favored in the first excited level.",

The dispersion is measured by wavevector-resolved BLS and exhibits a sharp change from an upward dispersion to a downward one, in agreement with theoretical predictions and micromagnetic simulations. Around the threshold current, we observe the coexistence of conventional magnons and antimagnons. Our work establishes antimagnons with inverted dispersion and is a first step towards exploring novel phenomena and applications due to magnon-antimagnon coupling, such as magnon amplification and magnon-antimagnon entanglement, which are part of the emerging field of antimagnonics.",

    "abstract": "Control of magnetic order in antiferromagnets is a central challenge in the development of next-generation spintronic devices. Here, we propose and analyze magnetization switching driven by the field-derivative torque, a torque that originates from the time-derivative of an applied THz pulse acting on the staggered order parameter. Using atomistic spin simulations, we show that the field-derivative torque couples efficiently to the Néel vector, enabling deterministic switching without net spin accumulation. Further, we show that using the circularly polarised THz pulse, the FDT-induced magnetization switching reduces the required THz magnetic field by two-fold. To this end, we compute the switching and non-switching areas as a function of THz pulse width, THz magnetic field, and damping of the antiferromagnetic material. We find that the switching and non-switching areas are completely deterministic in antiferromagnets. Moreover, the switching area increases by about 55% when the FDT is considered.",

We compare the performance of different optimization methods, showing that stochastic reconfiguration is a robust and reliable optimizer. We show that short range Jastrow factors are important for improving diffusion Monte Carlo, regardless of the quality of orbitals. Large active spaces are required to converge the variational energy, but ulitmately orbital optimization produces worse diffusion Monte Carlo energies when compared to standard orbitals from density functional theory. We show that this increased bias is due to larger locality errors from the use of pseudopotentials, while the fixed-node error is actually improved by using orbital optimization. Additionally, for observables other than energy, orbital optimization produces a systematically smaller mixed-estimator bias. Ultimately, we believe orbital optimization provides a reliable method to improve variational and pure fixed-node energies as well as lower mixed-estimator bias.",

    "abstract": "We analyze the WAHUHA Floquet protocol recently applied to arrays of Rydberg atoms and derive beyond-leading-order corrections in the high-frequency expansion of the effective spin theory. We find that an appropriate choice of the pulses times can enforce an approximate symmetry corresponding to the conservation of the total magnetization. The interaction channels emerging from higher-order Floquet terms affect three-body bound states (\\emph{trimers}), which gain a significant mobility. We estimate the corresponding enhancement in 1D spin chains and conclude that their dynamics is within experimental reach. Detrimental effects due to the proliferation of particles outside of the trimer magnetization sector are found to occur and spread on time-scales slower than the trimer propagation. Moreover, these can be suppressed in higher dimensional lattices, e.g. in 2D triangular lattices, as the lattice geometry brings these processes off resonance. Our results establish a concrete route to realizing mobile multiparticle bound states in Floquet-engineered Rydberg platforms.",

    "abstract": "Recent experiments have probed the stability of ring superfluids in the presence of Josephson barriers or Gaussian impurities. Here we present a theoretical analysis that extends beyond the regimes explored so far. We study the onset of dynamical instabilities induced by a one-dimensional potential rotating at an effective angular velocity $ω$, addressing both the tunneling and the hydrodynamic regimes. We show that the critical angular velocity $ω_c$ increases almost linearly with the number of barriers, with a slope set by their height and width. When the system is quenched into the dynamically unstable regime, it emits multiple solitons, which can switch or even reverse the direction of circulation. The stabilization mechanism is robust against imperfections of the potential and does not require a perfectly periodic array of barriers. In particular, we find that adding a disordered speckle potential to an ordered array of barriers can further increase $ω_c$: disorder can therefore make a ring superfluid more resilient to dynamical instabilities.",

It is widely known that extrinsic dopants impact the structure and stability of perovskite surfaces, but an atomic-scale view is missing. Here, noncontact atomic force microscopy (ncAFM) and photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/PES) are used to combine microscopic and spectroscopic evidence of cobalt adsorption, incorporation, and clustering at surfaces of two prototypical perovskites SrTiO3 and KTaO3. A number of different sub-ML coverages and temperatures of annealing were investigated.   Several common features are observed: cobalt shows a strong preference for ionic nature (+2 and +3 charge states), and remains dispersed as single atoms to a certain extent in both perovskites. Two competing mechanisms are observed upon annealing: coalescence into clusters with a mixed metallic/ionic character, and incorporation into the surface and subsurface regions. The latter is more pronounced in SrTiO3, where a cobalt-stabilized surface reconstruction is identified, whereas for KTaO3 cobalt likely incorporates in the near-surface region.",

    "abstract": "Colloidal quantum dots (cQDs) have emerged as a cornerstone of next-generation optoelectronics, offering unparalleled spectral tunability and solution-processability. However, the transition from laboratory-scale devices to sustainable industrial manufacturing is fundamentally hindered by spin-coating workflows, which are intrinsically wasteful and restricted to planar geometries. These limitations are particularly acute for high-performance cQDs containing regulated elements such as lead, cadmium, or mercury, where poor material utilization exacerbates both environmental burden and cost. Here we report a biphasic dip-coating strategy that redefines the material efficiency of nanocrystal film fabrication. By utilizing an immiscible underlayer to displace ~88% of the active reservoir volume, we demonstrate a deposition geometry that decouples material consumption from total precursor volume. Infrared PbS photodetectors fabricated via this approach maintain their performance against spin-coated benchmarks while reducing ink consumption by up to 20-fold. Our technoeconomic analysis reveals that this biphasic architecture achieves cost parity at film thicknesses an order of magnitude lower than conventional monophasic dip-coating. Our results establish a low-waste framework for solution-processed materials, providing a viable pathway for the resource-efficient manufacturing of optoelectronic devices.",

Computer simulations and experiments on stiff and conjugated polymers have revealed complex morphological crossovers, yet a unified theoretical description remains incomplete. Here we develop a coarse-grained, field-theoretic free-energy framework for linear polymers with variable stiffness that captures these morphologies and their transitions within a common description. The theory is built on three key ingredients: a density field describing monomer attraction and excluded-volume effects, a nematic order parameter accounting for orientational ordering in dense regions, and the bending rigidity of a worm-like chain. Using simple variational ansatzes for competing morphologies, we derive analytic expressions for their free energies and identify the boundaries separating coil, globule, toroidal, and rodlike conformational regimes as functions of the reduced attraction strength and the effective persistence length. The resulting phase-diagram topology provides a transparent free-energy-based framework for interpreting morphology diagrams observed in simulations and experiments on semiflexible polymers in poor solvents.

It has been recently conjectured that their continuation to two dimensions corresponds to the non-unitary conformal minimal models $\\mathcal{M}(2,2n+3)$.

The $i\\varphi^{2n+1}$ fixed points are identified using a perturbative expansion of the functional fixed-point equation near their upper critical dimensions, and they are followed to lower dimensions by numerical integration of the full equation. A peculiar feature of the complex $\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{T}$-symmetric potentials is that the fixed points are characterized by real but negative anomalous dimensions $η$, and in low dimension $d$, this can lead to a change of sign of the scaling dimensions $Δ=(d-2+η)/2$, thus requiring a novel analysis of the analytical properties of the functional fixed-point equations. We are able to follow the Lee-Yang universality class ($n=1$) down to two dimensions, and numerically determine the scaling dimension of the fundamental field as a function of $d$. On the other hand, within the LPA', multicritical Lee-Yang fixed points with $n>1$ cannot be continued to $d=2$ due to the existence of unexpected non-perturbative fixed points that annihilate with the $i\\varphi^{2n+1}$ fixed points.",

In contrast to the analytical quantum theories of non-equilibrium BEC [Shishkov et al., Phys. Rev.

Our results indicate that the temperature of the weakly interacting Bose gas is universally set by the density-dependent chemical potential, revealing a defining property of non-equilibrium BECs. Finally, we demonstrate that the stimulated nature of the cooling process directly governs the emergence of quantum coherence of the condensate and shapes the dissipative properties of the excited states.",

Our $ab initio$ calculations show that h-diamond has exceptionally high carrier mobility. Along $xy$ and $z$ directions, the hole mobilities at 300 K are 5631 and 5552 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, and the room-temperature electron mobilities are 11462 and 28464 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, respectively. These values are superior to the mobility of most known semiconductors including cubic diamond (c-diamond). The small effective masses in h-diamond, comparable to those in c-diamond, cannot explain the mobility difference between the two phases. For holes, scattering induced by transverse acoustic phonons is the predominant mechanism near room temperature in c-diamond, whereas considerably suppressed in d-diamond by selection rules. The high electron mobility in h-diamond can be attributed to the wavefunction at the conduction band minimum, which is extended and distributed primarily in the lattice interstitial, leading to weak coupling with scattering potentials. The temperature dependence of h-diamond is investigated as well, which deviates from the power-law relationship due to the significantly increased occupation of optical modes at elevated temperatures. Consequently, our findings reveal h-diamond as a promising high-mobility semiconductor, and elucidate the microscopic origin in terms of the carrier-phonon scattering mechanisms beyond conventional understandings based on simple parameters such as effective mass.",

By incorporating additional datasets (photometric galaxies and CMB lensing cross-correlations) and extending the bispectrum likelihood to smaller scales using a consistent one-loop theory computation, we achieve substantial gains in constraining power relative to previous analyses. Combining with the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data and using cosmic microwave background (CMB) priors on the power spectrum tilt and baryon density, we obtain tight constraints on the $Λ$CDM model, finding the Hubble constant $H_0=69.08\\pm 0.37~\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, the matter density fraction $Ω_m=0.2973\\pm 0.0050$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude $σ_8 = 0.815\\pm 0.016$ (or the lensing parameter $S_8\\equivσ_8\\sqrt{Ω_m/0.3}=0.811\\pm 0.016$), corresponding to $0.6\\%$, $1.7\\%$, and $2\\%$ precision respectively. Adding the Pantheon+ supernova sample (SNe), we find a preference of $2.6σ$ for the $w_0w_a$ dynamical dark energy model from low-redshift data alone, which increases to $2.8σ$ when exchanging the SNe with Planck CMB data. Combining full-shape data with BAO, CMB, and SNe likelihoods, we improve the dark energy figure-of-merit by $18\\%$ and bound the sum of the neutrino masses to $M_ν<0.057$ eV in $Λ$CDM and $M_ν<0.095$ eV in the $w_0w_a$ dynamical dark energy model (both at 95\\% CL). This represents an improvement of $25\\%$ over the background expansion constraints and the strongest bound on neutrino masses in $w_0w_a$CDM to date.

We analyze how the pulse asymmetry, the envelope type (Gaussian, Lorentzian and Sauter), and the carrier envelope phase jointly influence the momentum distribution and the number density of created pairs. Our results show that pair production exhibits extreme sensitivity to both the degree of temporal asymmetry and the steepness of the envelope on either side of the pulse. These effects are qualitatively explained through a turning-point analysis, which, for the first time, is carried out for a non-analytic electric field using a regularization scheme. We observed that multiphoton pair production dominates the Schwinger mechanism in the case of a long falling-pulse asymmetry.

We demonstrate that the number density can be enhanced by two to three orders of magnitude by choosing certain field parameters.",

    "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are commonly divided into repeating and apparently non-repeating sources, but whether these represent distinct physical populations remains uncertain. In this work, we apply an unsupervised machine learning methods combining Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) with density-based clustering to analyze CHIME/FRB Catalog 2. We find that FRBs remain primarily separated into two clusters in the multi-dimensional parameter space, with a recall of 0.94 for known repeaters, indicating strong robustness. Consistent with Catalog 1 analyses, we confirm that the spectral morphology parameter, specifically spectral running remains the key discriminator between the two populations, indicating that narrowband emission is an intrinsic and persistent property of repeating FRBs. With the enlarged Catalog 2 sample, we further identify a stable subclass of atypical repeaters (about $6\\%$ of repeating bursts) that are broadband, shorter in duration, and more luminous, resembling non-repeating bursts. The Nonrepeater-like cluster also shows higher inferred energies and dispersion measures, consistent with a scenario in which apparently non-repeating FRBs may result from observational incompleteness, with low-energy repeating bursts remaining undetected. Our results provide new statistical evidence for a physical connection between repeating and non-repeating FRBs.",

In this framework, the Standard Model (SM) gauge group is enlarged by a new $U(1)^\\prime$ component.

Each $ε_i$ is common to all fermions in a generation, which produces correlations among quark and lepton observables. The new neutral gauge boson $Z^\\prime$ has flavour violating couplings to quarks and leptons. For SM allowed processes, small deviations with respect to the SM predictions are found: this is a consequence of a feature of the model where quark and lepton sectors preclude each other large deviations from SM. Lepton flavour violating processes are allowed at tree-level. The experimental upper bounds for the rates of the processes $τ^- \\to μ^- μ^+ μ^-$, $μ^- \\to e^- γ$, $μ^- \\to e^- e^+ e^-$ and the $ μ^- \\to e^-$ conversion in nuclei play a hierarchical role in constraining the branching fractions of lepton flavour violating $B$ and $B_s$ decays.",

We investigate light DPs kinetically mixed with the visible photon that need not be the dark matter, focusing on resonant photon-DP oscillations in magnetized, modeled plasma environments. We show that realistic non-monotonic plasma density profiles generically enhance resonant conversion relative to monotonic models, leading to substantially stronger constraints on the photon-DP kinetic mixing parameter ($ε$).

    "abstract": "The extension of the Higgs sector with an additional complex triplet field is often considered for generating the neutrino mass by the Type-II seesaw mechanism. Such an extension generally predicts $ρ\\neq1$, where $ρ$ is the electroweak rho parameter at the tree level, so that the renormalization of the electroweak parameters is different from models like the standard model (SM) and two Higgs doublet models. In this paper, we present a full set of radiative corrections to decays of the 125 GeV Higgs boson ($h$) in this model. One-loop contributions of the extra Higgs bosons as well as SM fermions and gauge bosons to the decay rates of $h$ are calculated in the on-shell scheme. Gauge dependence appearing in the counter terms of mixing angles is eliminated by the pinch technique. Higher-order QCD corrections are also implemented. We find that the decay rates can significantly deviate from the predictions in the SM and other extensions such as the two Higgs doublet models and the singlet model. For example, the decay rates of $h\\to WW^\\ast$ and $h\\to ZZ^\\ast$ can be a few percent larger than the SM value under current experimental and theoretical constraints. In this case, deviations in $h\\to γγ$ and Higgs self-coupling can reach about $-20\\%$ and $100\\%$, respectively. The pattern of the deviations is different from the other extended Higgs models.

In this work we use $(3+1)$-dimensional lattice simulations of a scalar model with thermal initial conditions to quantify how thermal fluctuations distort bubble profiles and modify the resulting GW spectrum. We find that thermal fluctuations can strongly break spherical symmetry at early times, allowing even an isolated bubble to emit GWs. In multi-bubble simulations, thermal fluctuations systematically reshape the spectrum, suppressing the infrared part while enhancing and broadening the high-$k$ tail. We further provide an analytical estimate for the ultraviolet regime of the GW spectrum, which is in good agreement with our lattice results and suggests that this regime is dominated by thermal fluctuations. These effects could leave observable imprints in future GW searches.",

This new channel is always present when considering the thermally-induced Higgs decay to leptons and relativistic sterile neutrinos, and can become dominant thanks to thermally-generated lepton-doublet flavour oscillations. This mechanism can yield the observed baryon asymmetry in our universe, even if there is no resonant enhancement from quasi-degenerate sterile neutrinos. The required active-to-sterile neutrino mixing differs from the other two low-scale leptogenesis channels and can be probed in fixed-target and long-lived particle experiments, and by displaced vertex searches at high-energy colliders.",

We derive a directionality factor arising from the relative bulk motion between the neutrino medium and plasma, and show that it can produce an anomalous frequency dependence of the polarization-rotation angle, distinct from the $ω^{-2}$ scaling of Faraday rotation. This anomalous scaling can occur either at the resonance plasma frequency condition $ω\\simeq ω_p$, or when $E_ν^{0}\\simeq m_νω/ω_p$ lies within the range of the neutrino energy spectrum. We estimate the effect for three scenarios: jets propagating through the cosmic neutrino background (C$ν$B), jets with an internal flux of high-energy neutrinos, and accretion-disk plasma permeated by the C$ν$B. Of the three scenarios, the latter gives the largest rotation angle $φ_{\\rm d} \\sim 10^{-35}\\,\\mathrm{rad}$, at X-ray frequencies.

As a by-product of the analysis, we obtain the full one-loop running of the strong coupling in SMEFT, including electroweak corrections, and the associated decoupling constants when the top quark and heavy electroweak bosons are integrated out. Although generally moderate, the loop-level dimension-six corrections can be enhanced through tadpole effects and top-quark loops, and can shift symmetric phase parameters at the 5% level under reasonable assumptions.

This gauge symmetry forbids the decay of the lightest fermion $χ_1$ into Standard Model particles, rendering it automatically stable and providing a dark matter candidate without introducing an ad hoc stabilizing symmetry and domain-wall problem. The mass of $χ_1$ is generated by the vacuum expectation value of a singlet scalar near the electroweak scale, naturally realizing a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) freeze-out scenario. Dark matter annihilation proceeds through scalar mediation, allowing the observed relic abundance to be reproduced while remaining consistent with current direct-detection constraints. It naturally realizes the secluded dark matter scenario and can be further tested in the next generation of experiments.",

Within this framework, we can investigate the interplay between the chiral and deconfinement transitions. Compared to other approaches based on multi-parameter Ansätze of the Polyakov loop potential fixed from comparison to finite-temperature lattice data, the modeling of the glue sector in the present set-up depends on only one phenomenological parameter that can be fixed by comparison to lattice data in the vacuum. We detail the structure of the phase diagram, with special emphasis on the finite density axis, and compute thermodynamical observables relevant for applications. We also highlight the properties of the recently introduced net quark number response of the medium as a sensible probe of the phases of QCD, in particular as a tool to disambiguate the nature of certain regions of the phase diagram where the use of the Polyakov loops could lead to misinterpretations. Finally, we critically assess the sensitivity of our results to the various parameters, both in the glue sector and in the chiral sector.",

All new fields, which have nonzero charges under the non-invertible symmetry, can be dark matter candidates, since the non-invertible symmetry possesses a remnant ${Z}_2$ symmetry that plays a role in assuring the stability of our dark matter candidate. Even though the non-invertible symmetry is dynamically broken at one-loop level, its violation does not affect our scenario. In this paper, we especially consider the lightest mode of the neutral components in the doublet vector-like fermions as our main dark matter candidate. The dark matter is potentially degenerated to the other two families of neutral fermions, since the mass difference is induced at one-loop level. Thus, we consider our dark matter candidate in rather simpler co-annihilation system among their particles. Considering all the constraints of neutrino oscillation data, lepton flavor violations, muon $g-2$ and the relic density of dark matter, we perform the numerical analysis and show some allowed regions for these phenomenology. Due to our dark matter nature, the sum of neutrino masses in case of normal hierarchy is larger than that in case of inverted hierarchy, which is opposite situation compared with typical active neutrino models.",

    "abstract": "We present a study of the inclusive charmless semileptonic $b$ decay, $b\\to X_u\\ell\\barν$ at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative QCD, with the primary aim of extracting the hadronic structure functions $W_i$ at NNLO. The analysis is based on a numerical calculation of the relevant kinematic distributions using a phase-space slicing method to handle infrared-sensitive contributions from real gluon emissions. We use known results from Heavy Quark Effective Theory and Soft-Collinear Effective Theory to extract the singular terms and construct a model for the regular contributions to the structure functions at NNLO, then perform a fit to the numerical results. We use our approximate structure functions to compute various kinematic distributions and moments: the comparison with existing analytic and numerical results shows very good agreement, which is further improved including the available analytic results in the fit.",

    "title": "Exploring Quantumness at Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiments",
    "abstract": "Violations of classicality can be probed through measurements performed on a system at different times, as proposed by Leggett and Garg. Specifically, violations of Leggett-Garg inequalities suggest the presence of quantum effects in macroscopic systems. Long-baseline neutrino experiments provide some of the longest available propagation distances over which such tests can be performed. Previous studies of Leggett-Garg tests in the neutrino sector have largely focused on showing that the oscillation probabilities can violate classical bounds for certain parameter choices. In this work, we develop a more complete and data-driven framework that treats both the distributions representing the classical and quantum behavior, as well as the experimental uncertainties. We consider MINOS, T2K, NOvA, as well as the upcoming DUNE, and present the respective statistical significance for distinguishing quantum behavior from classical scenarios at these long-baseline neutrino experiments. Among them, we find that T2K yields the most significant violation of classicality, at the level of $\\sim 14 σ$, with NOvA and projections for DUNE also resulting in a significance of more than $5σ$.",

    "abstract": "A dense neutrino plasma can exhibit collective flavor evolution caused by neutrino--neutrino refraction. Recently, a new class of exact nonlinear inhomogeneous solutions was discovered: single-wave (SW) solutions of the fast flavor system. The key property is that the flavor occupation numbers remain homogeneous, whereas the field of flavor coherence varies spatially with a single wave vector. The equations of motion for this structure resemble those of a collection of classical spins, in analogy with the homogeneous slow and fast flavor cases. In contrast, the SW system is not integrable (it does not possess Gaudin invariants) so that, while two-beam pendulum solutions are inevitable, they do not extend to a multi-angle system. We develop a taxonomy of all known nonlinear collective flavor solutions, explaining the overlap between categories and their differences.",

    "abstract": "DAMSA (DArk Messenger Searches at an Accelerator) is a novel short-baseline accelerator experiment aimed at probing short-lived physics processes, including searches for evidence of a dark sector of particle physics and well-motivated Standard Model signals. Motivated by open questions in neutrino physics and the absence of conclusive evidence for conventional weakly interacting massive particles, DAMSA targets MeV-to-sub-GeV dark-sector messengers with feeble couplings that can be produced in abundance at the PIP-II LINAC. By employing an ultra-short baseline of order one meter, DAMSA is uniquely positioned to overcome the beam-dump \"ceiling\" that limits sensitivity to promptly decaying particles in longer-baseline experiments. The conceptual design emphasizes a beam-dump production scheme combined with a compact detector optimized for rare decays while mitigating intense neutron-induced backgrounds inherent to high-power proton beams. To validate the experimental strategy and detector technologies, the Little DAMSA Path-Finder (LDPF) proof-of-concept experiment is proposed, focusing on axion-like particles decaying to two photons and operating with 300 MeV electron beams at FAST. Successful realization of LDPF will establish the feasibility of the DAMSA approach, enabling a broad and powerful program to explore short-lived new physics and precision Standard Model processes in a previously inaccessible regime. This conceptual design document outlines the technical details of DAMSA's physics goals, the beam facility proposals, key experimental challenges and how to overcome them, and the proposed experimental staging campaigns.",

    "abstract": "We provide a study of the parameter space of the complex 2-Higgs Doublet Model (C2HDM), focusing on signs of large CP-violating couplings of the 125 GeV Higgs boson with the fermions. The study is performed utilizing Machine Learning (ML) techniques developed recently for parameter space exploration, including an Evolutionary Strategy Algorithm and Novelty Reward. We give particular attention to the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM). We confirm that the recently found kite diagrams are crucial for the outcome of the analysis. Moreover, their use also mitigates the dependence of the results on the scale and scheme choice of the masses in the loop diagrams. We furthermore point out that, already at the current level of experimental precision, the Barr-Zee diagrams with charm quark loops must be taken into account. The combined use of kite diagrams and ML techniques allows for the resurrection of large fermion CP-odd couplings for Type-II and Flipped C2HDM when the 125 GeV Higgs coincides with the second lightest neutral scalar. This arises due to cancellations, typically of the per-mil order, which, moreover, will still be possible for a foreseeable eEDM precision down to $10^{-33}$ e.cm. For these cases, the constraints on the CP-odd couplings arises from the precision LHC measurements.",

As an application, we express five-point splitting constraints - the reduction of the five-point amplitude to products of four-point amplitudes on special kinematic loci - as linear relations among the five-point partial-wave coefficients. At low mass levels these constraints, together with spin truncation, fix the full five-point partial-wave data in terms of the four-point coefficients and imply simple compatibility conditions; remarkably, imposing two independent splitting loci also forces the residue to vanish on their intersection, making the associated hidden zero manifest in partial-wave space. We also show that once both channels allow spin-2 exchange a genuine kernel can remain, indicating the need for additional higher-point input to achieve complete rigidity.",

    "abstract": "Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) exhibits complementary descriptions of hadrons: a rest-frame picture based on confinement, chiral symmetry breaking and interquark forces, and a high-energy light-front picture expressed through parton distributions (PDFs,TMDs,GPDs) and form factors. This review develops a unified framework that connects these two domains. It is based mostly on multiple studies by the authors in the past few years. Using the Instanton Liquid Model (ILM) to capture essential nonperturbative features of the QCD vacuum, we derive effective interactions for mesons, baryons, and multiquark states, construct their wave functions in hyperspherical coordinates, and boost them to the light front. The resulting light-front Hamiltonians, incorporating both perturbative and instanton-induced dynamics in the Wilsonian spirit, provide realistic nonperturbative inputs for computing PDFs, DAs, GPDs, quasi-distributions, and gravitational form factors at a well-defined low scale. The connection to perturbative QCD is then established by matching gradient-flow-renormalized operators and LF wave functions to the standard $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme. Perturbative DGLAP and ERBL evolution then connects these predictions to experimentally accessible regimes. % This approach is applied to quarkonia, glueballs, light mesons, baryons, tetraquarks, pentaquarks, and higher multiquark hadrons, yielding consistent descriptions of both their spectra and partonic structure. Special emphasis is placed on the energy-momentum tensor and the mechanical properties of hadrons, which emerge naturally from the same dynamical ingredients. Overall, the framework demonstrates a clear continuity between hadronic spectroscopy and partonic observables, offering a coherent multiscale picture of hadron structure rooted in the underlying dynamics of QCD.",

The theoretical foundation of this method is that the one-matrix model admits an eigenvalue distribution $ρ(λ)$, and that the moments $w_n$ generated from it satisfy the loop equations. Our framework is designed to numerically determine a self-consistent pair of $ρ(λ)$ and $w_n$ that simultaneously satisfies these two requirements. In the concrete implementation, we employ a least-squares method, for which no sign problem arises in principle, and therefore the method can be formally applied also to Minkowski-type models. Actual numerical calculations show that this bootstrap approximation reproduces, with very high accuracy, the exact solutions for Euclidean-type models and the perturbative results for Minkowski-type models.",

Also, we show that the bumblebee field within this technique is proportional to the tangential vector of the (timelike or spacelike) geodesic curve in the background vacuum spacetime, and can be easily found knowing the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Moreover, we prove that this technique can be extended to the case of any non-zero cosmological constant and the presence of the electromagnetic field. We apply this generating technique and obtain the bumblebee extension of the Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT-(anti-)de Sitter spacetime. We show that this extension is not unique, as it depends on the exact geodesic curve one chooses to associate a bumblebee field with. Then, by considering various special cases of this generic solution, we demonstrate that the condition of the global reality of the bumblebee field limits the set of geodesics with which we can associate it.",

This structure modifies the variational principle and the definition of conserved quantities relative to GR. We derive the symplectic potential, presymplectic current, and Hamiltonian generators associated with transverse diffeomorphisms, and we identify a set of boundary conditions under which the WTG action is differentiable. These include Dirichlet and Neumann conditions for both the auxiliary Weyl-invariant metric and the dynamical metric, as well as a natural implementation of York boundary conditions, for which WTG exhibits a particularly transparent geometric formulation. We obtain the Noether current and surface charge, clarify the role of the Lagrangian ambiguity related to the cosmological constant, and evaluate the Hamiltonian identity on spacetimes containing a bifurcate Killing horizon.

The lattice DB cohomology we construct retains many essential properties of the continuum DB cohomology and naturally incorporates a notion of self-linking number. The lattice $U(1)$ Chern-Simons action formulated using the lattice DB cohomology is expressed as a simple quadratic form via the star product, which naturally exhibits level quantization. Framed Wilson lines respecting staggered symmetry are defined in a gauge-invariant manner, and their expectation values are shown to be given by the self-linking number, as follows from completing the square. Using the lattice Hodge decomposition, we explicitly characterize the DB cohomology on a three-dimensional cubic toroidal lattice and present a gauge-fixed, rigorous path integral for the lattice Chern-Simons theory. To regulate divergences in the lattice Chern-Simons path integral arising from staggered symmetry, we introduce a small Maxwell term.

Near this point, we uncover universal behavior characterized by a critical exponent 1/2, which places this gravitational lensing system within the mean-field universality class.

    "abstract": "It has been proposed that any coupling constant in a covariant action   can be treated as a conserved charge by promoting the coupling constant to auxiliary fields, typically realized by a scalar field paired with a   higher-form gauge field. However, the procedure may break local symmetries,   which can be explicitly shown in a simpler setting such as Maxwell theory.   The Hamiltonian analysis of Maxwell theory with the auxiliary fields   reveals that some of the constraints are second-class. Applying the BFT formalism, we restore the broken local symmetries and obtain   a fully symmetric action defined on an extended configuration space. Despite the restoration of the local symmetries, no additional conserved charges are associated with the recovered symmetries.   Consequently, the original theory turns out to be the gauge-fixed version of the   extended theory.",

    "abstract": "We construct four-dimensional de Sitter space as an excited state, rather than as a vacuum configuration, in type IIB, heterotic SO(32), and heterotic E_8 \\times E_8 string theories. This framework provides a mechanism to evade vacuum-based no-go theorems for de Sitter solutions in string theory. Starting from a generic M-theory configuration, we obtain de Sitter isometry in the dual string theories through appropriate dynamical duality sequences in the late-time limit. The excited state, identified as a Glauber-Sudarshan state, is constructed as the expectation value of the metric operator in M-theory using path-integral techniques.   We further analyze the conditions required for the existence of a well-defined effective field theory description and show that these conditions are equivalent to the Null Energy Condition for a (3+1)-dimensional FLRW cosmology. Finally, we investigate constraints arising from axionic cosmology and demonstrate how the time-dependent solutions are modified when experimental bounds on the axionic coupling constant are taken into account.

The operator flow equations for such deformations induce a particular Legendre Transformation between flowed Lagrangians and flowed Hamiltonians. The marginal deformation does not change the conformal symmetries of the theory, until some special points in the moduli space are reached, and the relativistic conformal algebra smoothly changes to the Carrollian conformal (equivalently BMS) one. We investigate this change of symmetry from both configuration space and phase space point of view, while keeping the notion of Legendre Transformation unchanged during the flow. By expanding the actions, in the extreme limits of the flow parameter, we recover the usual ``Electric'' Carroll theory and further uncover a novel ``Magnetic'' counterpart. We discuss the intriguing geometric understanding of such dynamical maps for the deformed theories, and also provide a concrete example for the same from a deformed string theory in flat space.",

Such a phase appears to be in tension with a state counting interpretation of the partition function and its relation to the de Sitter entropy. It has been recently argued that the phase associated with the gravitational path integral can be cancelled by including the contribution of an observer. In this note, we compute the total phase of Vasiliev higher spin gravity on the sphere by summing over the contributions of all spins. We evaluate the resulting infinite sum using two different regularization schemes, obtaining consistent results. We find that for the non-minimal Vasiliev theory, which includes massless fields of all integer spins, the total phase vanishes in all dimensions. This result suggests that the sphere partition function of these theories may be consistent with a counting interpretation, without explicitly including an observer.",

By diagonalizing the quadratic Casimir together with spatial translations, we provide a harmonic expansion of operators in what we call the Kontorovitch-Lebedev-Fourier (KLF) space. This momentum space shares many structural properties with its Minkowski counterpart, for instance: equations of motion reduce to algebraic equations, and the quadratic dynamics provides a simple propagator analogous to flat space. We reformulate the perturbative computation of in-in correlators in KLF momentum space, showing from first principles how time integrals turn into frequency-space integrals over meromorphic functions. We show how our construction streamlines computations, naturally accommodates the contributions from principal and complementary series in the Källén-Lehmann spectral decomposition of composite operators, and leads to an inversion formula for the spectral density.",

A well-known class of such vacua is provided by the DGKT solutions of massive type IIA string theory, where scale separation arises from large fluxes. In this work, we construct a ten-dimensional brane geometry whose near-horizon limit reproduces the DGKT vacua, using a flux-backtracking approach combined with intersecting D4-brane stacks dual to the unbounded flux sector. We then use this setup to test whether the brane worldvolume theory decouples from the bulk. Modes localised near the branes, deep in the AdS throat, are found to be infinitely redshifted with respect to asymptotic observers. Moreover, an analysis of graviton fluctuations shows the presence of an infinite potential barrier near the branes, providing a direct indication of decoupling. We conclude by comparing these results with recent arguments against decoupling in scale-separated AdS vacua, which focus on the asymptotic region where modes are blueshifted.",

We used the tidal forces together with the stellar binding forces to determine the Roche radius for neutron stars, white dwarfs, and Sun-like stars, and to investigate how the Simpson--Visser regularization affects the tidal disruption of these astrophysical objects.

We find that the nonlinear tails of massive scalar fields, opposite to massless ones, decay as the same rate as linear tails in the intermediate time, independent of source parameters or initial conditions. Nevertheless, quadratic quasinormal modes could serve as a probe to the nonlinear effects of massive fields.",

By using scalaron mass as a free parameter we find that the shadow shape along with displacement and asymmetry is sensitive to the scalaron mass, even after keeping the black hole spin low. We recognize scalaron mass which is compatible with Kerr like quadrupole moment and hence black hole \"no-hair\" theorem. The same mass scale is found to reproduce the PPN parameter ($γ$) constrained in the weak field limit of the solar system. Gravitational identifiers, the Kretschmann scalar ($κ$) and gravitational potential ($φ$) have been used to infer scalaron masses in the regime of S-stars which are found to be consistent with the limits obtained using shadow scales.

    "abstract": "A couple of milliseconds after the merger of a binary system of neutron stars can play a fundamental role in amplifying the comparatively low initial magnetic fields into magnetar strengths. The basic mechanism responsible for this amplification is the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) and we here report the first systematic study of the impact of rapid rotation on the KHI-amplification process exploiting general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations at very high-resolutions of $35\\,{\\rm m}$. Concentrating on four different spinning configurations, we find that aligned, anti-aligned, and mixed (aligned/anti-aligned) spin configurations lead to markedly different growth rates of the electromagnetic (EM) energy, field topologies, and vortex properties when compared to the irrotational case. These differences arise from intrinsic variations in the system dynamics, such as tidal deformation, collision strength, and contact surface area, with the anti-aligned configuration producing the largest vorticity and growth in EM energy. Importantly, while different spin configurations lead to significantly different initial growth rates of the poloidal/toroidal components, all systems converge to a specific topological partition. Our simulations are confined to a short window in time, but the different EM energies produced as a result of spin will imprint the EM emission at merger and provide information on the spinning state at merger.",

    "abstract": "Bouncing cosmologies offer an alternative to inflation by resolving the initial   singularity through a contracting phase followed by a bounce into expansion. In many   such models, the contracting phase is dominated by a single matter component,   typically pressureless dust, which leads to an almost scale-invariant spectrum of   scalar cosmological perturbations with a slight blue tilt, so that generating the   observed red-tilted spectrum within this framework was challenging. In this work, we   consider a more realistic scenario in which the contracting phase includes both   matter and radiation, as required on physical grounds. We show that the presence of   radiation can naturally induce a red tilt in the spectrum of curvature perturbations   seeded by quantum vacuum fluctuations in the remote past of the contraction. Since   the perturbations of the two fluids are coupled via gravity, vacuum initial   conditions must be carefully defined. We demonstrate that, without fine-tuning, the   resulting entropy perturbations are subdominant with respect to curvature   perturbations. This suggests that a minimal two-component bounce model, involving   only ordinary matter and radiation, can connect to the standard expanding cosmology   with observationally viable initial conditions.",

Reconciling these models with local tests often requires strong screening, leading to environment-dependent clustering. We investigate such effects via a late-time structure-induced phase transition driven by a non-minimally coupled scalar field. For this purpose, we introduce norns, a fully relativistic cosmological particle-mesh code that self-consistently evolves a complex scalar field - a generalisation of the symmetron producing global U(1) strings rather than domain walls. Using simulations, we compare string and wall-forming models, quantifying impacts on the matter power spectrum, halo mass function, and defect dynamics. Strong environment-dependent effects can generate significant departures from LCDM in underdense regions while keeping the overall power spectrum changes modest (~ 4-15% at k~0.3-0.5 h Mpc^-1, sub-percent for z > 0.2). We find that an attractive fifth force can locally suppress structure growth in voids while enhancing it in surrounding overdense regions by driving outflows from the voids. These effects leave distinctive signatures in the matter density probability density function and in marked halo power spectra, which are likely detectable in low-redshift data.",

Our results show that population parameters governing distributions with sharp features can be tightly constrained. Mixed populations can be disentangled with as few as $\\sim20$ detections, and even with model misspecification, the inference retains sensitivity to key population features.

The reconstruction of sunspot numbers from D14C was performed using a physics-based method involving several steps: using a carbon-cycle box model, the 14C production rate, corrected for the geomagnetic shielding, was computed from the measured data; The open solar magnetic flux was computed using a model of the heliospheric cosmic-ray modulation; Sunspot numbers were calculated using a model of the evolution of the Sun's magnetic field. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach was used to account for different sources of uncertainty. Results. Annual sunspot numbers were reconstructed for the first millennium CE. This period includes one extreme solar event of 774 CE and one Grand solar minimum of 650-730 CE. We could identify 91 solar cycles, of which 26 were well-defined, while 24 and 41 were reasonably and poorly defined, respectively. The mean cycle length was 10.6 years, but the lengths of individual cycles vary between 8 and 15 years. The existence of empirical Waldmeier's relations remains inconclusive. No significant periodicities were found beyond the 11-year cycle. Conclusions. This work fills the gap in the solar cycle statistics between the previously reconstructed first millennium BCE and the second millennium CE, providing vital constraints for the solar dynamo and irradiance models. A consistent 3-millennium-long reconstruction of sunspot numbers, based on a composite multi-proxy cosmogenic record, is pending.",

    "abstract": "We present Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array observations of multi-wavelength dust emissions at 3.1\\,mm and 1.3\\,mm; along with molecular line emissions of CO(2--1), CO(3--2), \\mbox{$^{13}$CO(3--2)}, and C$^{18}$O(3--2) at spatial resolutions of 7--45 AU towards the protoplanetary system AS 205. The dust emissions exhibit two distinct components of AS 205 N and AS 205 S, separated by 1.3 arcsec. While gas kinematics within the dust disk regions are dominated by Keplerian rotation, the more extended gas emission displays complex morphology and kinematics strongly affected by the binary gravitational interaction in the outer regions. The stellar masses of AS 205 N and AS 205 S are estimated at $0.78\\pm0.19$\\,M$_\\odot$ and $1.93\\pm0.86$\\,M$_\\odot$, respectively. Azimuthal variation is observed in the spectral index distribution of both disks. In AS 205 N, the spectral index minimum in the southwest is coincident with the peaks of CO($2-1$), CO($3-2$), and $^{13}$CO($3-2$) integrated intensity and the relative position of its southern counterpart. On the other hand, the spectral index distribution in \\ass~exhibits two prominent maxima, with the one in the northeast aligning with the peak of $^{13}$CO($3-2$), and the peak in the south coinciding with local maxima in CO($2-1$) and CO($3-2$) azimuthal profiles. These results suggest a correlation between dust grain size and/or optical depth with the gas distributions. Dust-trapping along the spiral arms possibly contributes to the spectral index minima in AS 205 N; however, the observed asymmetry across both disks suggests the involvement of additional mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Analyses of type Ia supernovae have helped us shed light on the existence and nature of dark energy. Most of these analyses have relied on Bayesian techniques. In this work, we rely on resampling techniques to analyse supernova data. In particular, we use the generalised least squares method together with Jackknife and Bootstrap techniques to estimate parameters of $Λ$CDM, flat $Λ$CDM, $w$CDM, flat $w$CDM, and flat $w_0\\,w_a$CDM models from the recent PantheonPlus and SH0ES data. For completeness, we also perform Bayesian analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and nested sampling algorithms, and compare the results. We note that resampling techniques can help highlight the limitations of the data. For instance, we see that the Jackknife method estimates a strong positive correlation between $h$ and $M$ and higher standard deviations for both. This may have significant implications for the Hubble tension. We conclude with a discussion of our results.",

    "abstract": "There is a long-acknowledged deficiency of bright red giants relative to fainter old stars within a few arc seconds of Sgr A*. We explore whether this could be due to tidal stripping by the central black hole. This requires putting the stars onto highly eccentric orbits, for which we evaluate diffusion by both scalar resonant and non-resonant relaxation of the orbital angular momentum. We conclude that tidal stripping does not discriminate sufficiently between main-sequence and red giant stars. While the tidal loss cone increases with stellar radius, the rate of diffusion into the loss cone increases only logarithmically, whereas the lifetime on the red giant branch decreases more rapidly than $R_*^{-1}$. In agreement with previous studies, we find that stellar collisions are a more likely explanation for the deficiency of bright red giants relative to fainter ones.",

    "abstract": "As the recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) approaches its next predicted thermonuclear eruption, it is currently exhibiting a \"super-active state\" (SAS) characterized by enhanced multiwavelength emission similar to the behavior recorded prior to the 1946 outburst. We present a multiwavelength analysis of the SAS and the subsequent \"faint state\" using observations from HST, Swift, NuSTAR, and XMM-Newton. Our results indicate that the SAS was driven by an increase in the mass accretion rate, which caused the accretion disk's boundary layer to become optically thick. A weighted least squares regression analysis quantifies the evolution of the accretion components, displaying a highly significant (4.5$σ$) increase in the luminosity of the optically thin cooling flow (L$_{cf}$) and a marginal (2.58$σ$) decrease in the optically thick boundary layer luminosity (L$_{bb}$) as the system transitioned into the faint state. We find that this dimming is consistent with an intrinsic change in the accretion flow rather than dust obscuration, supported by the lack of infrared excess and the stability of the 2175 Å feature. Additionally, a time-series analysis using autoregressive modeling to account for correlated red noise revealed no significant periodicities, thereby disputing the previously reported $\\sim$6000 s signal. These findings suggest that the pre-outburst evolution of T CrB is characterized by significant changes in the accretion disk structure and boundary layer, providing a self-consistent physical framework for the system's behavior as it approaches eruption.",

    "title": "A general spectral solver for the axisymmetric Jeans equations: fast galaxy modelling with arbitrary anisotropy",
    "abstract": "Dynamical modelling is a fundamental tool for measuring galaxy masses and density profiles in the era of large integral-field spectroscopic surveys and Bayesian inference. Solutions based on the Jeans equations are popular due to their robustness and computational efficiency. However, traditional semi-analytic Jeans solvers often require restrictive assumptions about the velocity anisotropy to remain computationally tractable. This paper presents a new spectral solver for the axisymmetric Jeans equations designed to overcome these limitations. I first illustrate, using orbit integrations in realistic potentials, that spherical alignment of the velocity ellipsoid is a physically well-motivated approximation for galaxy modelling. The new method employs a spectral technique to solve the Jeans partial differential equations directly. Two design choices are critical for accuracy and speed: (i) solving for the slowly-varying velocity dispersion rather than the rapidly varying pressure, and (ii) imposing a Robin boundary condition to enforce the asymptotic decay on a finite domain. This formulation supports arbitrary anisotropy distributions beta(r, theta) while simultaneously increasing computational speed by orders of magnitude compared to standard high-accuracy quadratures. Validated against exact analytic benchmarks, the solver recovers intrinsic moments with sub-percent accuracy. The implementation will be included in the public JamPy package and is structured to be optimally suited for massive parallelization on specialized hardware such as GPUs, enabling the rigorous exploration of complex parameter spaces.",

    "abstract": "FarView is a proposed low frequency radio interferometer for deployment on the lunar far side, enabled by the Moon's radio quiet environment. Operating over 1-50 MHz inaccessible from Earth, FarView will open a new observational window and promote discovery class science in cosmology, heliophysics, Galactic and exoplanet astrophysics. The primary science is measurement of the redshifted 21 cm signal from the Cosmic Dark Ages (z=30-100), identified by the Astro2020 Decadal Survey as a priority cosmology discovery area. FarView will deliver 3D tomographic measurements and precision power spectra of neutral hydrogen in a largely linear regime, enabling tests of inflationary initial conditions, primordial non Gaussianity, dark matter properties, neutrino masses, and early dark energy. The reference design consists of 100000 crossed dipole antennas in a dense core-halo configuration spanning 200 sq km. A compact 4 km core with 83000 dipoles maximizes sensitivity to large scale cosmological modes, while 20000 halo elements extending to 14 km provide angular resolution and calibration for foreground characterization. Sensitivity forecasts indicate a 10-sigma detection of the Dark Ages 21 cm power spectrum at z=30 over five years of half duty cycle lunar night observations. An FFT-based EPIC beamformer is identified as an efficient signal processing architecture. Beyond cosmology, FarView will enable interferometric imaging of low frequency solar radio bursts, advancing space weather studies. Additional capabilities include stellar space weather observations, Galactic cosmic ray tomography via free-free absorption, and searches for auroral radio emission from exoplanet magnetospheres, a probe of exoplanet habitability. FarView represents a flagship class opportunity to establish the Moon as a platform for foundational astrophysics while delivering unique observational capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Magnetars are extreme neutron stars powered by ultra-strong magnetic fields ($\\sim10^{14}$ Gauss) and are compelling engines for some of the most powerful extragalactic transients such as Super Luminous Supernovae, Gamma-Ray Bursts, and Fast Radio Bursts. Yet their formation rate relative to ordinary neutron stars remains uncertain, often precluding direct comparisons with the rates of these extragalactic transients. Furthermore, magnetars have been recently shown to be evolutionarily related to other neutron star classes, complicating the estimate of the exact magnetar fraction within the neutron star population. We study the magnetar birth fraction in core-collapse supernovae using pulsar population synthesis of all isolated neutron star classes in our Galaxy, incorporating self-consistently the Galactic dynamical evolution, spin-down and magneto-thermal evolution. This approach allows us to derive strong constraints from small close-to-complete observational samples. In particular, looking at the age-limited young ($<$2 kyr) neutron star population in the Milky Way we find 24 detected young neutron stars, with only 10 of them (41%) being classical rotational powered pulsars, while the others (59%) are either magnetars or central compact objects, the latter believed to be equally magnetically powered. We further compare the results with the nearby volume-limited class ($<$500 pc) of X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron stars, old nearby magnetars. We conclude that the observed population of isolated neutron stars in the Galaxy can be reproduced only by assuming a core-collapse supernova rate larger than two, and a larger magnetar fraction than previously inferred. By assuming a bimodal initial magnetic field ($B_0$) distribution at birth, we find that the magnetar class peaks between $B_0\\sim 1-2.5\\times10^{14}$ Gauss and represents on average $\\sim50$% of the entire neutron star population.",

    "abstract": "We use radiation-hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the formation and synthetic X-ray emission of hot bubbles within planetary nebulae (PNe) driven by the powerful winds of H-deficient, [Wolf-Rayet]([WR])-type stars. Our models, based on {\\sc mesa} stellar evolution tracks for 1--3 M$_{\\odot}$ progenitors, adopt a recent mass-loss rate prescription for [WR] stars and incorporate the enhanced radiative cooling of their C-rich material, comparing the results against standard H-rich PN models. The enhanced mass-loss in the [WR] models leads to an accelerated post-AGB evolution and a subsequent delay in hot bubble formation compared to their H-rich counterparts, as suggested by a previous work. By computing synthetic X-ray spectra that account for the mixed H-rich and H-deficient gas phases, we find that models incorporating [WR] winds exhibit significantly higher X-ray luminosities ($L_\\mathrm{X}$) than their H-rich counterparts, but the emissivity-weighted plasma temperature of the X-ray-emitting gas converge to values of $T_\\mathrm{X} = [1-3] \\times 10^{6}$~K, regardless of whether the system follows a [WR]-type or an H-rich post-AGB evolutionary path.

Subtracting molecular gas mass from these enclosed masses is not enough to reconcile with BH-galaxy relationships, but independently measuring M$_\\mathrm{enc}$ using the cold CO(2-1) gas does shift the black holes down to their expected values.

    "abstract": "Unresolved stellar companions can cause both under-estimations in the radii of transiting planets and over-estimations of their detectability, affecting our ability to reliably measure planet occurrence rates. To quantify the latter, we identified a control sample of 198 Kepler stars with sensitivity to Earth-like planets if they were single stars, and imaged them with adaptive optics. In 20% of systems, we detected stellar companions that were close enough to go unresolved in Kepler observations. We calculated the distribution of planet radius correction factors needed to adjust for these observed companions, along with simulations of undetected companions to which our observations were not sensitive. We then used these correction factors to optimize an occurrence rate model for small close-in planets while correcting Kepler's detection efficiency for the presence of unresolved companions, and quantified how this correction affects occurrence estimates. Median occurrence rates for small planets between $2-100$ days increased by an average factor of $1.08-1.19$ (depending on statistical treatments), with the largest differences found for smaller planets at larger orbital periods. We found that the frequency of Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone ($η_\\oplus$) increased by a factor of ${1.18}_{-0.66}^{+0.43}-{1.46}_{-0.83}^{+0.53}$ when accounting for the effect of unresolved companions on Kepler's detection sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Although galaxy evolution is governed by the interplay between baryonic physics and dark matter halo assembly, how halo properties shape observed galaxies remains unclear. With current challenges in measuring halo properties, the stellar-to-total dynamical mass relation is introduced as an alternative metric sensitive to the dark matter content within galaxies. We explore how spatially resolved stellar population properties vary across this relation using optical IFS data and photometry from 265 CALIFA galaxies. Spatially resolved ages and metallicities, [M/H], are derived using a Bayesian framework fed with a library of model spectra based on stochastic star formation and metallicity histories and dust attenuation. We study these properties in terms of both stellar and total dynamical mass, with the latter being enclosed mass within three effective radii from Jeans dynamical modeling. We find that ages and [M/H] measured at different annuli depend on both stellar and total mass, yet showing distinct radial trends. While the dependence of age on total mass is more prominent in the outskirts, that of [M/H] is significant in the inner parts. This behavior is reflected in the stellar population profiles and gradients, more strongly for age and connected to morphology. Intermediate-mass early-types have higher stellar-to-total mass ratios and flatter age profiles with older ages, and steep negative [M/H] profiles, whereas later-types have lower stellar-to-total mass ratios, negative age profiles with younger ages and shallower negative [M/H] profiles. Moreover, at fixed stellar mass galaxies have more negative age gradients and shallower [M/H] ones as total mass increases. Our results show that total dynamical mass is linked to systematic variations in stellar populations and radial gradients at fixed stellar mass, suggesting a relevant role of dark matter halos in shaping galaxy properties",

The source was subsequently monitored with SVOM and Swift from December 2024 to March 2025. We report the detection and multi-wavelength follow-up of this event, and describe the temporal and spectral evolution observed during the campaign. Data from SVOM/MXT, SVOM/ECLAIRs, and Swift/XRT were analyzed with log-parabola models to track flux and spectral variability. The source was detected in a bright state over the 0.3-50 keV range. During the three months of monitoring, the X-ray flux varied significantly, showing episodes of spectral hardening at high flux levels. The spectral curvature evolved more irregularly and did not show a clear trend with flux. A shift of the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) synchrotron peak to higher energies is seen when the flux increases. This constitutes the first blazar outburst discovered in X-rays by SVOM. The coordinated follow-up with Swift provided continuous coverage of the flare and highlights the strong complementarity of the two missions for time-domain studies of blazars. The flare shows no clear signatures of either Fermi I or Fermi II acceleration, suggesting a mixed Fermi I/II scenario.",

    "title": "A multi-wavelength approach of AGN feedback in LINERs: The case of NGC 4438",
    "abstract": "The presence of multi-phase outflows in low ionisation nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs) has been confirmed to be frequent, but the mechanisms that launch them are still under study. We aim to explore the connections between the ionised gas outflow, radio continuum structures and X-ray emission detected in the LINER NGC4438. We analyse L, C and X-band images (from 1.4 to 12 GHz) of the LINER NGC4438, combining high-resolution data from enhanced Multi Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN) and Karl G Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). We produce radio flux, spectral index maps, and an energetic model that allows us to characterise the source. We incorporate optical integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data (GTC/MEGARA) and Chandra X-ray data, with comparable resolution, to better trace the outflow, the AGN and their potential connection. We present new L, C, and X-band high-resolution, high-sensitivity radio images and spectral-index maps that probe $\\sim$ 25 pc scales in NGC 4438. These data reveal a close morphological correspondence between the radio structures and the ionised gas bubble. Using a spatially resolved energetic model based on radio flux and spectral index, we disentangle the compact AGN emission from the extended bubble for the first time, establishing their distinct physical origins. We measure a kinetic power of $\\sim 5\\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for the radio bubble, exceeding the power of the ionised outflow by more than three orders of magnitude. Our multi-wavelength analysis indicates that NGC 4438 is undergoing jet-mode feedback, where a low-luminosity, weakly collimated jet impacts the dense northern interstellar medium. This interaction drives shock-ionised gas, produces a moderate velocity outflow that removes material from the region, and generates thermal X-ray emission coincident with the radio and H$α$ cavity.",

    "abstract": "IRAS23226-3843 has been identified as a highly variable Seyfert galaxy and even as a changing-look active galactic nucleus based on optical spectra. Here we present follow-up observations - taken over the past five years - for examining the ongoing photometric and spectral variations in this remarkable galaxy. We carried out SWIFT observations of IRAS23226-3843 together with new optical spectra taken in 2023 and 2024. In parallel we investigate ASAS-SN photometric data from 2014 till 2025. IRAS23226-3843 stayed on a high continuum flux level in the X-ray as well as in the optical since a historic outburst in 2019. However, it shows strong short-term variations on timescales of a few months. Densely sampled ASAS-SN V-band continuum data from 2014 till 2025 confirm that behavior. IRAS23226-3843 switched from a clear Seyfert 1 type in December 2019 to a Seyfert 1.9/2 type in July 2020 based on its optical spectra. Afterward, it again became a Seyfert 1 type with symmetric broad single-peaked Balmer line profiles in January 2023. These spectra prove the repeating changing-look character of the galaxy.IRAS23226-3843 exhibits extreme high Balmer decrements Ha\\Hb based on their broad line components. The Balmer decrement values are on the order of 10. IRAS23226-3843 successively showed all types of broad line Balmer profiles during the past 25 years over periods of many years: asymmetric single-peaked, double-peaked, as well as single-peaked and symmetric profiles in addition to its Seyfert 1.9/2 transition. These variations are not clearly correlated with continuum and line intensity variations.",

    "abstract": "We present the discovery of HE0144-4657, an ultra metal-poor, CNO-enhanced star dynamically associated with the Helmi Stream disrupted dwarf-galaxy remnant. This star was first identified as a carbon-enhanced, metal-poor star candidate from the Hamburg/ESO objective-prism survey, then followed up with medium- and high-resolution spectroscopy. At [Fe/H]=-4.11, HE0144-4657 is the lowest metallicity star found in a stellar stream to date. Its chemistry is consistent with field halo stars in the same metallicity regime, and the light-element (atomic number Z<=30) chemical abundance pattern suggests that HE0144-4657 is a bona-fide second-generation star with a possible Population III progenitor in the 50Msun mass range with low explosion energy. One possible scenario for the origin of HE0144-4657 is that it was formed in an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy accreted by the Helmi Stream progenitor system before merging with the Milky Way. This discovery provides further evidence for the extragalactic origin of carbon-enhanced ultra metal-poor stars in the Milky Way and for the specific environments conducive to their formation.",

    "abstract": "The microlensing event Gaia20fnr is a long-duration, non-caustic-crossing binary-lens event at high Galactic latitude. Triggered by a photometric rise detected by the Gaia space mission, the event was followed up with observations from multiple ground-based facilities and four space telescopes: Gaia, NEOWISE, Swift, and TESS. We characterize the Gaia20fnr microlensing system by determining the physical and orbital properties of the binary lens, the nature of the luminous source, and the kinematics of both the source and the lens. We employed a binary-lens microlensing model including full Keplerian orbital motion and annual microlens parallax to fit the photometric data. The event is best explained by a K2 giant source at $D_{\\rm S} = 3.10 \\pm 0.10\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$ lensed by a stellar binary composed of $M_{\\rm L,1} = 0.46 \\pm 0.06\\,M_\\odot$ and $M_{\\rm L,2} = 0.52 \\pm 0.06\\,M_\\odot$ at a distance of $D_{\\rm L} = 0.54 \\pm 0.05\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$.

Gaia20fnr is one of the few microlensing events for which a complete Keplerian binary-lens solution has been derived. The model can be tested with follow-up radial-velocity and high-resolution imaging observations as well as forthcoming Gaia DR4 and DR5 astrometric time-series data. Its long duration, multi-peak structure, and extensive coverage make it a benchmark for studying faint nearby low-mass binaries through microlensing.",

    "title": "Clump-like Structures in High-Redshift Galaxies: Mass Scaling and Radial Trends from JADES",
    "abstract": "Massive star-forming clumps are a prominent feature of high-redshift galaxies and are thought to trace gravitational fragmentation, feedback, and bulge growth in gas-rich disks. We present a statistical analysis of clump-like structures in $\\sim$3600 galaxies spanning $2 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 8$ from deep JWST/NIRCam imaging in the JADES GOODS--South field. Clumps are identified as residual features after subtracting smooth Sérsic profiles, enabling a uniform, rest-frame optical census of sub-galactic structure. We characterize their physical properties, size--mass relations, and spatial distributions to constrain models of sub-galactic structure formation and evolution. We find that clumps in our sample are typically low-mass ($10^{\\sim7-8}M_\\odot$), actively star-forming, and show diverse gas-phase metallicity, dust attenuation, and stellar population properties. Their sizes and average pairwise separations increase with cosmic time (toward lower redshift), consistent with inside-out disk growth. The clump mass function follows a power law with slope $α= -1.50_{-0.17}^{+0.19}$, consistent with fragmentation in turbulent disks. We find a deficit of relatively young clumps near galaxy centers and a radial transition in the size--mass relation: outer clumps exhibit steeper, near-virial slopes ($R_{\\rm e}\\propto M_*^{\\sim 0.3}$), while inner clumps follow flatter trends ($R_{\\rm e}\\propto M_*^{\\sim 0.2}$), consistent with structural evolution via migration or disruption. These results provide new constraints on the formation, survival, and dynamical evolution of clumps, highlighting their role in shaping galaxy morphology during the peak of cosmic star formation.",

    "title": "JADES: Evolution of nitrogen abundances in star-forming galaxies from z ~ 1.5-7",
    "abstract": "We present nitrogen abundance measurements based on the low-ionisation [NII]6583 emission line for 588 galaxies between 1.5<z<7.0 from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). We detect the temperature-sensitive [OIII]4363 auroral line in 40 galaxies in our sample, affording $T_e$-based abundances for this subset. We find that the average N/O abundance ratio in our low-metallicity sample is at least 0.1 dex higher than z ~ 0 samples. In particular, we find significant scatter toward high N/O, with five galaxies being identified with enhanced nitrogen abundances (log(N/O)>-1.1) at low-metallicity (12+log(O/H)<8.0) from $T_e$-based measurements. Meanwhile, applying strong-line abundance measurements to the remainder of our sample reveals a further 14 candidate galaxies passing these abundance cuts, implying that around 13 % of 12+log(O/H)<8.0 galaxies at these redshifts are nitrogen-enhanced at this level. We find that N/O abundance in low-metallicity systems correlates with SFR, surface density of SFR, and surface density of stellar mass at high redshift, while only in high-metallicity systems does a correlation with stellar mass emerge. Despite healthy representation of these `moderately nitrogen-enhanced' galaxies (-1.1<log(N/O)<-0.6), no galaxies in our low-metallicity sample are identified as having log(N/O)>-0.6, abundances that are typical of high-redshift NIII]- and NIV]-emitters. This demonstrates that the extreme nitrogen enhancements seen in some NIII]- and NIV]-emitters are only attained during the most extreme starbursts. This suggests that these elevated abundances are caused by enrichment from young massive stars in extreme environments and that the impact of this enrichment pathway is milder, though still important, for high-redshift systems on the star-forming main sequence.",

    "abstract": "Dust attenuation modifies the observed spectral energy distribution (SED), leading to biases in the properties inferred from integrated SED fitting. As spatially resolved SED modeling becomes feasible for large high-redshift samples, it is increasingly important to assess how dust attenuation affects resolved mass estimates. We evaluate the impact of dust attenuation on stellar mass estimates derived from integrating spatially resolved SED fitting results. We perform spatially resolved and integrated SED fitting on a sample of 3408 galaxies at $3 \\leq z < 9$ from the GOODS South field, combining deep NIRCam from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) and HST/ACS imaging from GOODS and CANDELS. We compare galaxy-integrated properties derived from fitting the summed SED with those obtained from spatially resolved SED modeling. Using a two-component dust attenuation model with a variable slope, we investigate how the dust attenuation slope, A(V), and stellar population properties contribute to discrepancies in the resulting stellar mass estimates. Resolved stellar masses are systematically higher than integrated estimates, with a median offset of +0.24 dex. Resolved analyses recover higher dust attenuations ($ΔA(V)\\approx +0.08$ mag), lower birth cloud fractions ($Δμ\\approx -0.28$), and grayer attenuation curves ($Δδ_{\\mathrm{ISM}} = +0.08$), arising from preferential sampling of compact star-forming regions. Integrated fits underestimate stellar ages by $\\sim23\\%$ at $z < 5$ and 31$\\%$ at $z \\gtrsim 5$. The stellar mass offset correlates strongly with the age difference and the attenuation slope difference, indicating that age-dependent outshining and spatially varying dust geometry are primary drivers of the discrepancy between resolved and integrated stellar masses.",

    "abstract": "In the local Universe, supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses strongly correlate with their host-galaxies' stellar masses ($M_{*}$), but galaxies hosting faint AGN recently found by JWST may deviate from this relation. To constrain the M$_{\\text{BH}}$-M$_{*}$ relation at high redshift, we performed AGN-host image decomposition for 17 low-luminosity AGN galaxies at $z$\\,$\\sim$\\,4--6 using NIRCam images in the JADES GOODS-N field. These sources are identified as AGNs from broad H$α$ emission lines detected by the CONGRESS and FRESCO surveys. We used \\textsc{galfit+MCMC} to fit spatial profiles in 7 wide-band images and detected extended emission in 9 sources out of 17. The close spatial alignment between the extended components and the AGN centers indicates that this emission likely originates from the host galaxies. These sources are extended at 0.9--2.0~$μ$m, suggesting significant host-galaxy light in the rest-frame UV. For the sources with the host detection, the stellar mass inferred based on image decomposition result can be 1-2 dex lower than the results without image decomposition. The BH-to-stellar mass ratio spans $M_{\\text{BH}}/M_\\ast$\\,$\\sim$\\,0.01--1.48, placing them well above the local $M_{\\text{BH}}$--$M_\\ast$ relation. In contrast, the host-galaxy size--mass relation broadly agrees with previous measurements. Our results suggest that the host galaxies of these faint AGN are either genuinely under-massive compared to their black hole masses, or too compact to be spatially resolved.",

    "title": "JADES: Discovery of Large Reservoirs of Small Dust Grains in the Circumgalactic Medium of Massive Galaxies at $z\\sim3.5$ through Deep JWST/NIRCam Imaging and Grism Spectroscopy",
    "abstract": "Using JWST NIRCam imaging and grism spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) Origins Fields, we report spectroscopic redshift measurements of 1,445 emission-line galaxies at $z=0-9$. Within this sample, we identify two prominent galaxy protoclusters at $z = 3.47$ and 3.69, each anchored by massive dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). In the vicinity of these systems, we discover seven background galaxies at $z=3.6 - 6$ that simultaneously exhibit strong rest-frame optical emission lines (e.g., [O III] and H$α$) and unusually reddened UV-to-optical continua. We attribute this reddening to dust extinction arising from the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the foreground DSFGs at projected separations of 7-30 kpc. We infer a high dust column density ($\\gtrsim 10^{-1}$ Msun/kpc^2), substantially exceeding those measured in low-redshift halos and those predicted by hydrodynamical simulations like IllustrisTNG and FIRE-2. The steep extinction curves, comparable to or steeper than that of the SMC, indicate a dominant population of small dust grains in the high-redshift CGM. We conclude that DSFGs at this epoch host large reservoirs of dusty CGM enriched to solar metallicity. These extended dust components are largely invisible to (sub-)millimeter interferometers such as ALMA because of their low surface brightness. We discuss the physical processes in dust transport that might be key to reproducing our observations, including galaxy mergers, cool-phase gas outflows, dust shattering, sputtering and radiation pressure. Finally, we caution that foreground CGM dust extinction may redden background galaxies at intermediate redshifts to mimic Lyman-break galaxies at $z\\gtrsim10$.",

    "abstract": "We report a galaxy overdensity candidate at $z\\approx 10.5$ in the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). This overdensity contains 18 galaxies with consistent photometric redshifts and robust F115W dropouts within 8 comoving Mpc in projection. The galaxy number density is four times higher than the field expectation, accounting for one-third of comparably bright galaxies and nearly 50% of the total star formation rate at $10<z_\\mathrm{phot}<12$ in the GOODS-S field. Two compact members of the overdensity show potential Balmer breaks suggestive of evolved stellar populations or little red dots (LRDs). One-third of galaxies have close companions or substructures within 1 kpc at consistent photometric redshifts, implying more frequent interactions in an overdense environment. Most galaxies have stellar masses of 0.6-3$\\times10^8$ $M_\\odot$, half-light radii of $\\sim$200 pc, and star formation rates of $\\sim$5 $M_\\odot \\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$, with no significant deviation from typical high-redshift scaling relations. We find tentative evidence for a spatially varying Ly$α$ transmission inferred photometrically, consistent with an emerging ionized bubble. This overdensity provides a rare opportunity for probing the environmental impact on galaxy evolution and the onset of cosmic reionization within the first 500 Myr.",

These sources range from $M_{\\mathrm{UV}} = -22$ to $M_{\\mathrm{UV}} = -16$, with 19 objects at $z_{\\mathrm{phot}} > 14$. We estimate the UV slopes for the full sample from fits to the photometry and find evidence for a steepening of the relationship between the UV continuum slope and $M_{\\mathrm{UV}}$ to higher redshifts, a result that differs from prior analyses of brighter samples in the literature. We provide evidence that over one quarter of our sources have evidence for being morphologically extended, with many galaxies showing multiple bright knots or clumps even out to $z \\sim 13 - 14$, an indication of how galaxies at Cosmic Dawn are growing and evolving. We discuss JADES-GN+189.15982+62.28899, a GOODS-N F200W dropout galaxy at $z_{\\mathrm{phot}} \\sim 15 - 18$ which has been observed spectroscopically with JWST/NIRSpec in prism mode, resulting in a very low signal-to-noise spectrum that is consistent with the photometry and rules out a number of low-redshift solutions for the source. Finally, we use a subsample of 123 objects in our sample with spectroscopic redshifts to explore the usage of alternate fitting templates and a prescription for Ly-$α$ damping wing absorption, finding that both produce significant improvements to the estimated photometric redshifts.",

    "abstract": "Wisps are among the most prominent scattered light artifacts in JWST/NIRCam imaging. They often appear in certain regions of the detectors and contaminate observations at surface-brightness levels relevant for faint-source photometry. We introduce a new subtraction method that uses the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm to model and remove wisps. Using deep NIRCam observations from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) and other programs, we construct multi-component, filter- and detector-specific wisp templates that capture the wisp structures and their exposure-to-exposure morphological variations. Wisps in individual exposures are represented as non-negative linear combinations of these templates, consistent with their additive nature and reducing degeneracies relative to single-template scaling. Compared to existing approaches, our method delivers lower residual root mean square in wisp-affected regions and reduces photometric bias and scatter to levels consistent with clean detector areas. The NMF wisp templates are readily applicable to other datasets and are publicly released to support future NIRCam extragalactic surveys.",

We model the surface brightness profiles of these sources with single-component Sérsic profiles, performing Bayesian inference of galaxy structural parameters. We fit each of the $>10^5$ sources with every available JWST/NIRCam wide-band filter individually, amounting to over 3 million Sérsic profiles computed. We provide catalogs of this morphological information, building one of the largest extragalactic morphological datasets to date, which we share alongside imaging and photometry from the JADES Data Release 5. With this information, we analyze the rest-frame optical redshift evolution of the effective radius and the surface luminosity density within a radius of 1 kiloparsec, $Σ_{\\text{1 kpc}}$, for 24,692 galaxies at $z>1$. We find $r_{\\text{eff}} \\propto (1+z)^{-0.635 \\pm 0.013}$ kpc, while $Σ_{\\text{1 kpc}}$ is relatively constant across time. Additionally, we explore bulge-disk decomposition on a subset of 8,390 galaxies in the JADES deep imaging covering the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, finding the effective radius of the bulge-components to increase marginally with time, whereas the disk-component sizes evolve as $r_{\\text{eff,disk}} \\propto (1+z)^{-1.091 \\pm 0.043}$.

The catalogs are constructed from 35 space-based imaging mosaics obtained with JWST/NIRCam, JWST/MIRI, HST/ACS, and HST/WFC3, combining approximately 1250 hours of JADES imaging with extensive additional public JWST and HST observations in the GOODS fields. Sources are identified using custom signal-to-noise-based detection and deblending algorithms optimized for the depth, resolution, and complex point-spread-function structure of JWST imaging. Source centroids, shapes, and photometric apertures are determined using a new fast two-dimensional Gaussian regression method applied to detection-image profiles. We provide forced circular-aperture photometry, ellipsoidal Kron photometry, and curve-of-growth measurements for every source in every band. We introduce a new pixel-level regression framework to model photometric uncertainties as a function of aperture size and local mosaic properties, accounting for correlated noise in heterogeneous JWST mosaics. Photometric redshifts are computed using template-based fitting applied to both small-aperture photometry on unconvolved images and Kron photometry on common-PSF mosaics. The JADES DR5 catalogs supersede previous JADES photometric releases, and are publicly released through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes and an interactive web interface.",

Observations with the most extended baseline configuration offered by ALMA, achieving an angular resolution of $25 \\times 17$ mas ($3.3 \\times 2.2$ au), revealed a single, narrow ring with a deprojected radius of 144.4 au and width of 7.2 au, and no evidence of circumplanetary emission within the cavity. Injection and recovery tests demonstrate that these observations can rule out point-like emission at the location of WISPIT 2b brighter than $\\approx 45$ $μ$Jy at the $3σ$ level. While these data can rule out PDS 70c like circumplanetary emission, the upper limit is consistent with empirical mass-flux relationships extrapolated from the stellar regime. Visibility modeling of the continuum ring confirms that WISPIT 2b lies significantly interior to the mm dust ring, raising doubts about the ability of WISPIT 2b to be the only driver of the dust structure. Possible solutions include either another lower mass companion, residing between WISPIT 2b and the cavity edge, likely in the gap seen by SPHERE at $\\sim130$ au, or that WISPIT 2b is either substantially more massive than IR-photometry based estimates ($\\sim15$ $M_{\\rm Jup}$) or on a moderately eccentric orbit. The combination of observations sensitive to the gas and dust distributions on larger spatial scales and dedicated hydrodynamical modeling will help differentiate between scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect provides a powerful probe of the thermal pressure of ionised gas in galaxy clusters and the cosmic web; constrained simulations reconstruct the mass and velocity fields of the local Universe. We explore how these two may be mutually informative: the tSZ signal provides a benchmark for assessing the fidelity of constrained simulations, and constrained simulations contribute information on the positions, total masses and density profiles of cosmic web structures for use in tSZ studies. We focus on cluster predictions in the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) paradigm, introducing CSiBORG-Manticore, a new state-of-the-art suite of digital twins -- data-constrained posterior simulations whose initial conditions are inferred via Bayesian forward modelling. We develop a framework for scoring constrained simulations on their ability to match measured Compton-$y$ maps from Planck for cluster cutouts, and use it to demonstrate improvement from previous BORG reconstructions. We further validate halo masses against weak-lensing-calibrated X-ray masses from eROSITA. We also show how high-fidelity digital twins offer a practical route to extracting additional information from tSZ data through a novel calibration of the mass-observable relation, and provide a complementary framework to purely statistical analyses of Compton-$y$ maps. This paves the way for integrating the large-scale structure information inherent in constrained simulations into the study of CMB secondary anisotropies.",

The composition of the atmosphere of 55 Cnc e is still unknown but suggests the presence of volatiles. We have run cloud formation models on a grid of N-dominated, O-dominated, C-dominated and H-dominated atmospheres to investigate which type of cloud we could expect on hot super-Earths and hot sub-Neptunes ($1000$K $<$ T $<$ $3000$K). Our models combine radiative transfer with equilibrium chemistry of the gaseous and condensed phases, vertical mixing of condensable species, sedimentation, nucleation and coagulation. We find that the condensability of species is highly dependent on the oxygen abundance of an atmosphere. Oxygen poor atmospheres can be heated by UV and optical absorbers PS, TiO and CN which create temperature inversions. These inhibit condensation. Oxygen rich atmospheres are colder without temperature inversions, and are therefore more favourable environments for cloud formation. The major expected cloud component in O-dominated atmospheres with solar refractory abundance is TiO$_2$(s). Spectral features of clouds in these worlds are stronger in transmission than in emission, in particular at short wavelengths. We find a lack of optical data of solid species in comparison to the variety of stable cloud components which can form on hot, rocky planets.",

A newly developed machine learning model named MagNet helps us to tackle some of the most serious challenges in data mining by generating transverse fields of solar active regions. Being trained on line-of-sight magnetograms from Michelson Doppler Imager at Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO/MDI), Hα maps from Big Bear Solar Observatory and Kanzelhohe Solar Observatory and vector magnetograms from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager at Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO/HMI), this model provides vector magnetograms in active regions for SOHO/MDI data covering the strong solar cycle 23. In this study, we performed out-of-sample validation of the MagNet model with data from Imaging Vector Magnetograph (IVM) at Mees Solar Observatory, which was not included in the training process. Our results show good correlation between the AI generated data and the observed vector magnetograms and therefore strengthen the confidence of implementing MagNet to the entire SOHO/MDI archive and future scientific analysis of the AI generated data.",

    "title": "Does the solar oxygen abundance change over the solar cycle? An investigation into activity-induced variations of the O I infrared triplet",
    "abstract": "The determination of the solar oxygen abundance remains a central problem in astrophysics, as its accuracy is limited not only by models but also by systematics. While many of these factors have been thoroughly characterized, the effect of the solar activity cycle has so far remained unexplored. Due to its relative strength and accessibility, the O I infrared triplet is typically the primary choice for abundance studies. However, previous investigations have shown that abundances inferred from this triplet tend to be higher than expected on active stars, whereas such an overabundance effect is not observed for the much weaker forbidden O I 6300 Å line. This raises the question of whether a similar trend can be found for the Sun. To address this question, we analyze two decades' worth of synoptic disk-integrated Sun-as-a-star datasets from the FEROS, HARPS-N, PEPSI, and NEID spectrographs, focusing on the infrared triplet (7772, 7774, 7775 Å) and the forbidden O I 6300 Å line. The excellent signal-to-noise ratio of the PEPSI observations allows us to detect a weak but significant variation in the equivalent widths of the infrared triplet, corresponding to about 0.01 dex difference in abundance between activity minimum and maximum. This value is significantly smaller than the typical uncertainties on the solar oxygen abundance. Due to higher scatter, no comparable trend is found in the other data sets. Based on these results, we conclude that within the typical uncertainties presented in other works, we can assume the inferred solar oxygen abundance to be stable across the solar cycle, but that this effect may be significant for other, more active stars.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsic alignments are a major astrophysical contaminant for next generation large-sky surveys like Euclid and LSST. Large hydrodynamic simulations are crucial for informing the alignment modelling for these surveys. We measure position-position and position-shape correlations of a Luminous Red Galaxy sample from the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations, measuring the alignment signal for more than 4.9 million galaxies at redshift 0. We jointly model the clustering and alignment correlations to provide the tightest constraints on the alignment amplitude to date from a hydrodynamic simulation. We find that both the Non-Linear Alignment (NLA) and the more complex Tidal Alignment Tidal Torquing (TATT) models provide good fits to the data. We compare the measured $A_1$ amplitude to observational data and find good agreement. We measure the dependence of the NLA and TATT free parameters on halo mass. We also introduce a mass-dependent TATT model, TATT-M, by finding empirical relations between the halo mass and the TATT parameters. This allows us to fit TATT with only one parameter, $A_1$, with $A_2/A_1$ being a constant and $A_{1δ}/A_1$ being a function of halo mass. Using a Bayesian approach, we find that TATT-M is very strongly preferred by the data over NLA. Using the baryonic feedback variations of the FLAMINGO simulation suite, we test whether the TATT parameters are sensitive to feedback. Variations in AGN and supernova feedback do not significantly change the alignment amplitude beyond the change associated with the dependence of galaxy stellar mass on the strength of feedback. Our results inform the IA modelling for upcoming surveys by providing guidance on model choices, priors and sensitivities to feedback.",

In this work, we present a method for radio interferometeic image reconstruction using a data-driven prior for the radio sky based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). We first train a DDPM on radio galaxy observations from the VLA FIRST survey. We create simulated VLA, EHT, and ALMA observations of radio galaxies, then use an unsupervised posterior sampling method called Denoising Diffusion Restoration Models (DDRM) to reconstruct the corresponding images, using our DDPM as a prior. Our approach is agnostic to the measured radio interferometric data and naturally incorporates the physics of the measurement process. We are able to reconstruct images with very high fidelity PSNR>60, a marked improvement over CLEAN and similar image reconstruction methods using conditional DDPMs",

    "abstract": "In this study, we investigate the post-destabilization evolution of a filament in a gravity-balanced model. We adopt the filament model proposed by Solov'ev (2010), in which a dense filament is supported against gravity by the repulsive force between the filament current and its sub-photospheric image. We first performed an analytical investigation of this model. For the numerical study, we use a two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model that solves the MHD equations with the Lare2d numerical code. Results: In this filament model, analytical expressions are derived for the electric current density, plasma density, and their spatial distributions as functions of the model parameters. The total electric current and the filament weight are also calculated. For the numerical simulations, we constructed an equilibrium filament characterized by a magnetic field of $B_0$ = $10^{-3}$ T, mass density $ρ_0$ ~ 1.3 x $10^{-9}$ kg m$^{-3}$, and temperature T ~ 13000 K. The system was destabilized either by increasing the currents or by reducing the filament density, and its evolution was computed. In both destabilization regimes, the filament was ejected, then halted at a certain altitude, and subsequently fell back, repeating this cycle with a period of about 600 s. The maximum filament ejection velocity was approximately 80 and 40 km $s^{-1}$, respectively. Beneath the ejected filament a current sheet forms, where magnetic reconnection occurs. The maximum ejection altitudes were determined as functions of both the destabilizing currents and the degree of filament plasma dilution. Finally, we compared results of this MHD model with those of an ideal vacuum model and discussed all results.",

    "abstract": "Deuterated molecules are a useful diagnostic tool to probe the evolution and the kinematics in the earliest stages of star formation. Due to the low temperatures and high densities in the centre of pre-stellar cores, the deuterium fraction is enhanced by several orders of magnitude. We study the distribution of the emission and the deuteration of the two carbon chains HC3N and CH3CCH throughout the pre-stellar core L1544. We analyse emission maps of CH3CCH, CH2DCCH, CH3CCD, HC3N, HCC13CN, and DC3N, observed with the IRAM 30m single-dish radio telescope. We use non-LTE radiative transfer calculations, combined with chemical modelling of the molecular abundances, to constrain physical parameters of the observed species. Following this, we derive the column density and deuteration maps. We find D-fractions of N(DC3N)/N(HC3N)=0.04-0.07, N(CH2DCCH)/N(CH3CCH)=0.09-0.15, and N(CH3CCD)/N(CH3CCH)=0.07-0.09. The deuteration of HC3N appears homogeneous across the core, with widespread D-fraction values above 0.06, tracing intermediate-density gas in the outer layers of the core. CH3CCD is most efficiently formed in the higher-density regions towards the core centre, while the D-fraction of CH2DCCH traces a local density enhancement in the north-east of the core, coinciding with the CH3OH emission peak. The results suggest that gas-phase reactions dominate the formation and deuteration of both HC3N and CH3CCH in L1544, with spatial variations driven by physical structure, density and external radiation. The significantly higher D-fraction of CH2DCCH compared to CH3CCD and a tentative gradient with higher values in the north suggest different deuteration mechanisms for the two functional groups. Similarities between the CH2DCCH emission and CH2DOH might indicate an additional deuteration pathway of CH3CCH on the surfaces of dust grains, as observed for H2CO.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by recent claims of a possible redshift dependence in late-Universe determinations of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), we test the robustness of this behaviour using multiple cosmological probes. We perform a joint redshift-binned analysis of $H_0$ across eight bins using late-Universe probes -- Pantheon+ SNe~Ia, DESI BAO, cosmic chronometers, and water megamasers -- under three cosmological frameworks: flat $Λ$CDM, CPL, and Padé cosmography. Under a common baseline scheme, all three models show a qualitatively similar, low-amplitude variation in the per-bin $H_0$ estimates. A simple Fourier-like parametrization captures this behaviour, but the amplitude differs from zero only at a marginal significance of about $1.71$--$1.94\\,σ$, with similar behaviour observed across all three cosmological frameworks. We then investigate the robustness and possible origin of this feature. Alternative binning schemes preserve its qualitative form, whereas single-probe per-bin fits (SNe-only, CC-only, BAO-only) yield ratios $H_{0,i}/H_{0,\\mathrm{global}}$ mostly consistent with unity and do not reproduce the pronounced drift seen in the joint baseline constraints. Finally, by comparing different global versus piecewise-constant configurations for $\\{H_0,Ω_m,M,r_d\\}$, we find that a baseline-like oscillatory pattern re-emerges only when multiple degenerate parameter combinations are allowed to vary across bins, while it is strongly suppressed when only $H_0$ is bin-dependent. Taken together, these results indicate that the apparent oscillatory behaviour of $H_0(z)$ in late-time arises from known parameter degeneracies and does not constitute robust evidence for a genuine redshift evolution.",

This sGRB was observed by multiple satellites and ground-based observatories across the electromagnetic spectrum. This study presents temporal and spectral analyses from radio to gamma-ray frequencies, spanning several observation periods beginning after the trigger and continuing for nearly 2 days. The results of the temporal and spectral analyses of the prompt episode, the extended X-ray component, and the afterglow phase are consistent with a millisecond magnetar undergoing accretion. The long-lasting X-ray emission is attributed to the internal energy dissipation of the magnetar spin-down power, governed by the magnetization parameter; the extended optical/IR plateau to synchrotron afterglow emission with energy injection; and the steep decay to changes in microphysical parameters during the post-jet break phase. The X-ray observations are consistent with the superposition of spin-down luminosity and synchrotron afterglow scenario. These findings suggest that the compact-object remnant is most likely a long-lived magnetar.",

    "abstract": "Most efforts in the modeling of recurrent novae have centered on the initial phases of the explosion and ejection, overlooking the subsequent interaction of the ejecta, first with the accretion disk orbiting the white dwarf and ultimately with the secondary star. To address this gap, a series of 3D smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations was conducted. These simulations explored the dynamic interactions between the nova ejecta, accretion disk, and stellar companion within the framework of the recurrent nova system U Sco. Notably, the simulations incorporate rotation around the system's center of mass. The primary goal of these simulations was to qualitatively examine the impact of various model parameters, including ejecta mass, velocity, and density, as well as the mass and geometry of the accretion disk. Simulations reveal complete disruption and sweeping of the accretion disk orbiting the white dwarf star for models with flared disks and Mejecta/Mdisk larger than 1. In contrast, V-shaped disks with a (constant) high initial density and Mejecta/Mdisk < 1 partially survive the impact with the nova ejecta. A very minor chemical contamination of the secondary star is anticipated in the U Sco case based on the limited impact of nova ejecta particles on the subgiant in all simulations. Minor mass ejection from the subgiant's outer layers is observed during the late-stage collision with ejecta and disk material, with some particles ejected from the binary system and some accreted by the white dwarf.",

    "abstract": "T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) is one of the eleven known recurrent novae in our Galaxy. It was observed in outburst in 1866 and 1946, with additional likely eruptions recorded in 1217 and 1787. Given its predicted recurrence period of approximately 80 yr, the next outburst is anticipated to occur imminently, thus motivating a thorough examination of the main characteristics of this system. We present new hydrodynamic models of the explosion of T CrB for different combinations of parameters (i.e., the mass, composition, and initial luminosity of the white dwarf, the metallicity of the accreted matter, and the mass-transfer rate). We show that mass-accretion rates between 10-8 - 10-7 Msun yr-1 are required to trigger an outburst after 80 yr of accretion of solar-composition material onto white dwarfs with masses about 1.30 - 1.38 Msun. For lower white dwarf luminosities, less massive white dwarfs, or reduced metallicity in the accreted material, higher mass-accretion rates are required to drive an explosion within this timescale. A decrease in metallicity or initial white dwarf luminosity leads to higher accumulated masses and ignition pressures, resulting in more violent outbursts. These outbursts exhibit higher peak temperatures, higher ejected masses, and greater kinetic energies. Models computed for different white dwarf masses but identical initial luminosities reveal significant differences in the elemental abundances of a wide range of species, including Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Ar, K, Ca, and Sc. These compositional differences offer a potential diagnostic tool for constraining the parameter space and discriminating between the various T CrB models reported in this study.",

    "abstract": "Transmission spectroscopy serves as a valuable tool for probing atmospheric absorption features in the terminator regions of exoplanets. Stellar surface heterogeneity can introduce wavelength-dependent contamination that complicates the interpretation of planetary spectra. We aim to investigate the atmosphere of the warm sub-Saturn NGTS-5b through optical transmission spectroscopy. Two transits were observed with the low-resolution Optical System for Imaging and low-Intermediate-Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). Chromatic transit light curves were modeled to derive optical transmission spectra and multiple Bayesian spectral retrievals were performed to characterize the atmospheric properties. Model comparisons provide strong evidence for contamination from unocculted stellar spots. A joint retrieval of the transmission spectra, assuming equilibrium chemistry, indicates a relatively clear atmosphere with a sub-solar C/O ratio of $<$0.22 (90% upper limit) and a low metallicity of $0.10^{+0.34}_{-0.05} \\times$ solar. Retrievals assuming free chemistry yield strong evidence for the presence of $\\rm H_2O$, with its abundance constrained to $\\log X_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = -0.79^{+0.14}_{-0.17}$. However, the abundances of other species remain unconstrained due to the limited optical wavelength coverage. The discrepancies between the two NGTS-5b transit spectra can be attributed to varying levels of stellar contamination. NGTS-5b thus appears to host a relatively clear, water-rich atmosphere, pending confirmation from additional observations of molecular bands in the infrared.",

    "title": "Development of an early warning method incorporating pre-supernova neutrino light curves",
    "abstract": "Massive stars ($M>8\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$) emit neutrinos known as pre-supernova (pre-SN) neutrinos through thermal and nuclear interactions for cooling the stellar core during the final stage of stellar evolution. Real-time monitoring of their pre-SN neutrino interaction rate offers a crucial opportunity to issue an early warning to a core-collapse supernova. Some neutrino detectors, including KamLAND and Super-Kamiokande already operate pre-SN alarm systems based on a statistically significant excess of the observed event rate over the expected background. To improve alarm sensitivity, we propose an alarm method which incorporates the time evolution of the observed pre-SN neutrino event rate. The method uses a log likelihood ratio test that references multiple theoretical stellar-evolution models and treats the core collapse time as a nuisance parameter to be profiled over. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using simulated data for the KamLAND, Super-Kamiokande with dissolved Gadolinium (SK-Gd) and their combined analysis. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in the warning time compared to the conventional rate-only method, while maintaining the same false alarm rate.",

    "title": "The reason for the occurrence of W-type contact binaries",
    "abstract": "For more than half a century, the puzzling W-type phenomenon in contact binaries has challenged astrophysicists. In these systems, the less massive component exhibits a higher surface temperature than its more massive companion, which is a reversal of the typical A-type configuration, where the more massive star is hotter. This counterintuitive temperature inversion defies the basic stellar physics and still lacks a widely accepted explanation. In this study, we assembled a sample of over 3,000 extensively observed contact binaries and derived their complete set of physical parameters. Our statistical analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between the occurrence of W-type contact binaries and the intensity and frequency of magnetic activities. This result strongly supports the hypothesis that magnetic activities are the primary driver of the W-type phenomenon and offers a compelling explanation for the observed transitions between the W-type and A-type.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we review the extended halo material and the circumgalactic medium (CGM), including both dust and gas, and discuss promising science cases that could be realized using the KASI Deep Rolling Imaging Fast Telescope (K-DRIFT). Scattered starlight from cirrus clouds in our Galaxy poses one of the major challenges to studying the low surface brightness features of extragalactic sources. Therefore, it is essential to investigate how to discriminate extragalactic sources from the cirrus cloud features. At the same time, interstellar dust clouds themselves are fundamental to understanding dust properties and the interstellar radiation field, both of which are essential for studies of chemical evolution and star formation in our Galaxy. Measuring the reddening of background sources, such as quasars, with K-DRIFT, which benefits from its broad field of view and accurate background subtraction, allows for effective detection of extended dust in galactic halos, the CGM, and intracluster space. Observations of the H-alpha emission lines can be used to identify signatures of star formation activity within galaxies, as well as the environmental effects acting on them. Galactic winds driven by active galactic nuclei and starbursts can be traced through H-alpha emission. Strong ram pressure stripping effectively removes the interstellar medium (ISM) from galaxies. The stripped ISM becomes ionized or dissociated through mixing with the hot intracluster medium (ICM), forming H-alpha tails. The surface brightness of these H-alpha tails correlates not only with the presence of star formation in the tails but also the mixing stage of the stripped ISM and ICM. The H-alpha survey with K-DRIFT will enable the investigation of the evolutionary stages of ram pressure stripped galaxies in cluster environments, as well as the multiphase gas reservoir around galaxies and in the CGM.",

    "abstract": "Post-common envelope binaries (PCEBs) consisting of a white dwarf (WD) plus a main-sequence (MS) star can constrain current prescriptions of common envelope evolution (CEE) and calibrate theoretical models of binary formation and evolution. Most PCEBs studied to date have typical orbital periods of hours to a few days and can be well explained by assuming inefficient CEE to expel the envelope. However, there are currently several systems with relatively wide orbital periods ($>$18 days). To explain these wide PCEBs, additional sources of energy have been suggested to be taken into account. Here, we present the discovery and observational characterization of a compact object ($M\\,\\geq\\,0.58\\,\\rm M_{\\odot}$) with a K-type star companion in the solar neighborhood ($d\\sim 112$ pc) and an orbital period of $P_{\\rm orb}\\sim 14$ days. The compact object binary is likely to be a system consisting of a WD and a barium dwarf. Such a system with an orbital period within the gap between tight and wide binaries provides a test of whether additional energy sources are required to explain its formation. Using binary evolution models, we investigate the evolutionary history of this wide PCEB system and find that the observed properties of this source can be explained without invoking any extra energy source.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation surveys such as the Euclid survey, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) survey are expected to discover ~10^5 galaxy-galaxy scale strong gravitational lenses. This motivates the development of scalable and robust lens modeling approaches that can efficiently and reliably learn from wide-field survey datasets before high-resolution follow-up. We design a scalable, Bayesian, Lenstronomy-based pipeline and apply it to a sample of sixteen lens candidates observed with the Parallel Imager for Southern Cosmology Observations (PISCO) on the Magellan telescope. PISCO provides four-band imaging (z, i, r, g) with colours, depth and seeing conditions comparable to LSST. To fully exploit the constraining power of this dataset, our pipeline performs simultaneous multi-band modeling, using a common mass profile across all four bands while allowing independent light profiles in each. This approach leverages color information to provide joint constraints on the lens mass and yields reduced uncertainties compared to single-band analyses. Fifteen out of sixteen PISCO lens candidates are successfully recovered with interpretable lensing configurations, including DESJ0533-2536, the first reported hyperbolic-umbilic galaxy-galaxy scale strong lensing candidate. We further assess how much model complexity can be reliably constrained given the resolution and seeing of PISCO-like data. Overall, our results demonstrate that scalable, multi-band lens modeling of ground-based data can extract meaningful constraints on mass and source morphology, providing a practical pathway to maximize the scientific return from large samples in upcoming surveys.",

    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive catalog of 251 potential counterparts for 250 unassociated hard X-ray sources detected in the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) 150-month hard X-ray survey. Over 150 months of observation, BAT has detected 2339 sources in the 15-150 keV energy range. Among these, 344 do not have a previously identified low-energy counterpart. Our study focuses on the analysis of soft X-ray observations at energies below 10 keV, spatially overlapping with these new Swift-BAT hard X-ray sources. Such observations were taken with Chandra, Swift-XRT, eROSITA, and XMM-Newton. Within the sample of 251 potential counterparts, 94 (37 percent) are identified as active galactic nuclei and 58 (23 percent) as galaxies. The remaining 99 sources (40 percent) include pulsars, cataclysmic variables, and unclassified soft X-ray counterparts in the 0.5-10 keV band. Redshift information is available for 139 out of the 251 sources, and its distribution is in close agreement with the redshift distribution of previous BAT catalogs. We also present the results of a small optical spectroscopy campaign of 9 out of 58 galaxies. The majority of these are classified as Seyfert 2 galaxies at redshifts slightly larger than the median of the BAT AGN sample.",

At the MeV scale, Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis constrains the fractional variation of the weak freeze-out temperature, |δτ_f/τ_f|, thereby mapping light-element abundances into limits on deviations from the standard expansion history. At low redshift, we confront the model with type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and cosmic-chronometer data, which respectively probe distances, the late-time standard ruler, and the Hubble rate. Independent analyses highlight the complementary roles of each dataset, while a joint SNe Ia + BAO + CC fit breaks degeneracies and yields the tightest combined bounds. As an illustration, we examine two representative torsion-modified gravity scenarios: BBN strongly limits large departures from standard cosmology, whereas late-time probes remain compatible with a near-ΛCDM background. This unified approach demonstrates the power of linking early-Universe nuclear physics with precision cosmological observables in assessing torsional extensions of gravity.",

Here we report on the $500\\,\\mathrm{ks}$ observation of the magnetar 1E 1547.0-5408 performed by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in March 2025.

Phase-resolved spectral and polarimetric analyses reveal that X-ray thermal radiation likely originates from a single, fairly small hot spot with a non-uniform temperature distribution. Fitting the phase-dependent $\\mathrm{PA}$ measured by IXPE with a rotating vector model (RVM) constrains the source geometry and indicates that both the dipole axis and line-of-sight are misaligned with respect to the spin axis. Under these conditions, the high polarization of the source cannot be regarded as compelling evidence for the presence of vacuum birefringence in the star magnetosphere. Nevertheless, the fact that the RVM successfully reproduces the modulation of the X-ray polarization angle and the behavior of $\\mathrm{PD}$ with the energy hint once more to the presence of QED effects in magnetars.",

    "abstract": "3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object whose activity provides critical insights into its composition and origin. However, due to its orbital geometry, the object is too close to the Sun near perihelion to be observed from the ground, and space-based measurements are therefore required. Here we characterize the water production rate of 3I/ATLAS using SOHO/SWAN Lyman-$α$ observations from 2025 November to December (heliocentric distances 1.4 to 2.2 au) with 3D Monte Carlo modeling. We report a peak post-perihelion water production rate of $Q_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} \\approx 4 \\times 10^{28}$ mol s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a minimum active fraction of $\\sim$30\\% (assuming a maximum nucleus radius of 2.8 km). Comparison of our post-perihelion measurements with published pre-perihelion results reveals a heliocentric asymmetry, with an $r_h^{-5.9 \\pm 0.8}$ scaling for the inbound rise, followed by a shallower $r_h^{-3.3 \\pm 0.3}$ scaling during the outbound decline, where $r_h$ is heliocentric distance. The post-perihelion behavior indicates that the water production of 3I/ATLAS was driven primarily by the varying solar insolation acting on a stable active area. Combined with other evidence, including comparison with the hyperactive comet 103P/Hartley 2, our findings suggest that its water production is likely dominated by a distributed source of icy grains. Furthermore, it displayed remarkable stability in the activity with no signs of outbursts or rapid depletion of water production.",

    "abstract": "Observational studies have made substantial progress in characterizing quenching as a function of stellar mass and environment, but they are often limited in their ability to constrain quenching timescales and to determine the dominant environmental process responsible for the shutting down of star formation. To address this, we combine recent Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) observations with the SHARK v2.0 semi-analytic model to study the quenching of satellite galaxies in groups and clusters. We generate mock SDSS-like observations to calibrate the hot halo and cold interstellar medium (ISM) gas stripping prescriptions against observed satellite quenched fractions, finding that the previously adopted stripping prescriptions in SHARK v2.0 are too aggressive and overestimate the quenched fraction of satellite galaxies. Reducing the efficiency of both hot and cold gas stripping yields excellent agreement with observations for low- and intermediate-mass satellite galaxies. We use the calibrated model to investigate quenching timescales and find that satellites quench more quickly in clusters compared to groups, with timescales that generally decrease with increasing stellar mass. The long (>2 Gyr) timescales we measure favour hot halo gas removal as the dominant driver of satellite quenching.",

    "abstract": "We present an upgraded detailed numerical calculations of supernova (SN) interactions with significantly aspherical circumstellar matter (CSM), primarily formed as a disc or bipolar lobes. The circumstellar disc can arise as a result of, for example, mass transfer in a binary, while bipolar lobes can be the result of a violent pre-explosive ejection of matter, similar to the iconic cases of luminous blue variable stars (LBVs). We numerically simulate the radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) behaviour of interaction processes using a 2D cylindrical version of the RHD code CASTRO. We then calculate light curves, spectral patterns, and polarisation profiles, all up to a relatively long time of two years after an SN shock breakout and from different directions, using the multidimensional Monte Carlo radiation transfer (MC-RT) codes SEDONA and SIROCCO. We calculated a total of five models for the two aforementioned configurations of the surrounding CSM, for stratified density levels, comparing the simulated hydrodynamic behaviour and differences in their observable properties. RHD models exhibit similar behaviour to previous adiabatic models, but with a significantly slower expansion velocity. The calculated light curves show a relatively smooth evolution in SN-disc interaction, and declines and brightening in SN-lobes interaction. Comparing models with real events with a presumed similar physical process provides guidance for selecting a more accurate CSM configuration when simulating real situations.",

Some pieces of evidence have emerged to complete and confirm theoretical calculations and expectations. We discuss in the present work an interpretation of the behavior of the ''Crab Twin'' pulsar PSR B0540-69 in terms of the evolution of the magnetic field/quakes, connecting the behavior of the braking index with the underlying platelet drift and sudden discontinuous rearrangement (fast-slip) and long-term ones (slow-slip events), suggested by analogy with existing theoretical picture observed in the Earth's crust. The relationship of this scenario with permanent torque-changing glitches seen in the Crab and other young pulsars, and a set of similar events in the same object and others is addressed. We conclude that this physical approach is in principle consistent with all these sudden events, and point out future work to clarify the whole picture.",

    "abstract": "Establishing ages for young clusters is key for properly tracking the star formation history of a region. In this paper we investigate a new approach to estimating ages for young populations, based on the well-founded assumption that the initial mass function is the same throughout a star forming cloud. We trial this method for six young clusters in the Perseus star forming region. For all six clusters, we construct new member samples in a homogeneous way using Gaia DR3. We estimate masses by comparing 2MASS photometry to theoretical isochrones, including Monte Carlo simulations to propagate the errors. We compare the mass distributions of the clusters for a range of plausible ages, looking for a combination of ages that results in indistinguishable mass distributions across the region. We find the best fit for ages of 1 Myr for NGC1333+Autochthe, 2 Myr for IC348, 2-3 Myr for Heleus, 3-4 Myr for Mestor, 4-5 Myr for Electryon+Cynurus, and 5-8 Myr for Alcaeus. All other combinations of ages are ruled out by this criterion. The established age sequence is consistent with the relative ages inferred from disc fractions, and broadly aligns with the age sequence determined in previous studies using isochrone fitting. We suggest that this approach can be a useful complement and cross-check to established methods to estimate ages in young populations.",

    "title": "Dynamic shocks powered by a wide, relativistic, super-Eddington outflow launched by an accreting neutron star in the mid-20th century",
    "abstract": "Accreting systems can launch powerful outflows which interact with the surrounding medium. We combine new radio observations of the accreting neutron star X-ray binary (XRB) Circinus X-1 (Cir X-1) with archival radio observations going back 24 years. The $\\sim3$ pc scale wide-angle radio and X-ray emitting caps found around Cir X-1 are identified as synchrotron emitting shocks with significant proper motion and morphological evolution on decade timescales. Proper motion measurements of the shocks reveal they are mildly relativistic and decelerating, with apparent velocity of $0.14c\\pm0.03c$ at a propagation distance of 2 pc. We demonstrate that these shocks are likely powered by a hidden relativistic ($\\gtrsim0.3c$) wide-angle conical outflow launched in $1972\\pm3$, in stark contrast to known structures around other XRBs formed by collimated jets over 1000s of years. The minimum time-averaged power of the outflow required to produce the observed synchrotron emission is $\\sim0.1L_\\text{Edd}$, while the time-averaged power required for the kinetic energy of the shocks is $\\sim40 \\left(\\frac{n}{10^{-2} \\text{cm}^{-3}}\\right)L_\\text{Edd}$, where $n$ is the average ambient medium number density. This reveals the outflow powering the shocks is likely significantly super-Eddington. We measure significant linear polarisation up to $52\\pm6\\%$ in the shocks demonstrating the presence of an ordered magnetic field of strength $\\sim200~μ\\text{G}$. We show that the shocks are potential PeVatrons, capable of accelerating electrons to $\\sim0.7~\\text{PeV}$ and protons to $\\sim20~\\text{PeV}$, and we estimate the injection and energetic efficiencies of electron acceleration in the shocks. Finally, we predict that next generation gamma-ray facilities may be able to detect hadronic signatures from the shocks.",

    "title": "Solar twins in Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec I. Building a large catalog of Solar twins with ages",
    "abstract": "[Abbreviated] Context. Solar twins, stars whose stellar parameters (Teff, log g, and [M/H]) are very close to the Solar ones, offer a unique opportunity to investigate Galactic archaeology with very high accuracy and precision. However, most previous catalogs of Solar twins contain only a small number of objects (typically a few tens), and their selection functions are poorly characterized. Aims. We aim at building a large catalog of Solar twins from Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec, providing model-driven, rather than data-driven, stellar parameters including ages, together with a well-characterized selection function. Methods. Using stellar parameters from the Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec catalog, we selected Solar-twin candidates whose parameters lie within +- 200 K in Teff, +- 0.2 in log g, and +- 0.1 dex in [M/H] of the Solar values. Candidates unlikely to be genuine Solar twins were removed using Gaia flags and photometric constraints. We determined accurate ages for individual twins with a Bayesian isochrone-projection method, considering three combinations of parameters: Teff, [M/H], and either log g, M_G, or M_Ks. We also constructed a mock catalog to characterize the selection function. Results. Our final GSP-Spec Solar-twin catalog contains 6,594 stars. The mock catalog consisting of 75,588 artificial twins well reproduces the main characteristics of the observed catalog, especially for ages determined with M_G or M_Ks. To demonstrate the usefulness of our catalog, we compared chemical abundances [X/Fe] with age. We statistically confirmed the age--[X/Fe] relations for several species (e.g., Al, Si, Ca, and Y), demonstrating that trends previously identified in small but very high-precision samples persist in a much larger, independent sample. Conclusions. Our study bridges small high-precision Solar-twin samples and large data-driven ones, enabling demographic studies of Solar twins.",

    "abstract": "Compact galaxy groups are ideal laboratories for studying the effects of interactions between AGN and multiple nearby galaxies. Recent JWST observations of the nearby compact group Stephan's Quintet highlight tidal flows between the interacting galaxies as well as outflows from the active galaxy NGC 7319. To study the kinematics on a large scale throughout the group, we obtained spatially-resolved long-slit spectra of Stephan's Quintet at multiple slit positions with Apache Point Observatory's Kitt Peak Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph. We fit multiple Gaussians to the H$α$ $λ$6563 Å and [N II] $λλ$6548, 6583 Å emission lines to isolate the different kinematic components. We used the kinematics to develop the first biconical outflow model of the narrow-line region of NGC 7319. Using a combination of galactic rotation models, biconical outflow models, and kinematic maps of the ionized gas, we disentangled the outflows, rotation, and tidal flows in the group. We found outflow radial velocities up to 550 km s$^{-1}$ peaking at 2.6 kpc from the central supermassive black hole, and a transition from AGN-powered outflows to gravitationally-powered tidal flows at a projected distance between 2.4 -- 6.3 kpc. We performed a line ratio analysis and determined the gas shows Seyfert-like ionization out to 6.3 kpc (projected), which supports our finding that gas outside this radius is predominantly powered by tidal flows. Our separation of kinematic components in Stephan's Quintet will enable future studies of the physical conditions and dynamical forces in the ionized gas to better quantify the feeding and feedback processes of AGN in compact groups.",

    "abstract": "We present serendipitous simultaneous radio and X-ray light curves of the dwarf Seyfert galaxy UGC 6728 spanning 5 years. The X-ray light curve exhibits a flaring period, followed by a gradual rise and decline. Throughout these events, the X-ray hardness ratio and spectrum do not change significantly. The radio flux is constant, as far as can be determined from its sparse sampling, until the end of the X-ray flare, then decreases by a factor of two by the midpoint of the gradual X-ray rise before returning to baseline at the end of the X-ray decline. We interpret this behavior in light of a similar event recently reported in NGC 2992, in which there is a temporary obscuration of the radio source by a blob of plasma ejected by a magnetic reconnection in the accretion disk. The energetics of the X-ray flare are consistent with those expected from magnetic disk activity. As in NGC 2992, the X-ray spectrum does not evolve during the obscuration event. We also discuss the possibility that the observed phenomena are due to normal AGN coronal flaring and variability, which is plausible but unlikely given the lack of spectral variation.",

    "title": "A Stratification in Magnetic Field Structures: The Radio Outflow in NGC 4151",
    "abstract": "The nature of radio outflows in radio-quiet AGN remains poorly understood. In this study, we present kpc-scale polarization observations of the Seyfert galaxy NGC\\,4151 using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in B-array at 3 and 10 GHz. We find that the inferred magnetic (B-) field structures show a stratification: a `spine-sheath'-like structure, with fields perpendicular to the jet direction in the `spine' and parallel in the `sheath', is observed in the higher resolution (0.5 arcsec) image at 10 GHz. In addition, a `wind'-like component with B-fields perpendicular to the radio outflow is observed in the 3 GHz image (resolution 2 arcsec); this feature is prominent along the `receding' (eastern) jet direction. Rotation measure (RM) ranges from $-230$ to 250 rad m$^{-2}$ over the polarized regions, indicating a low-electron-density ($10^{-2}-10^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$) tenuous medium surrounding the source causing Faraday rotation. A {tentative} RM gradient of $+75$ to $-25$ rad m$^{-2}$ is observed transverse to the northern `wind' component, while a similar gradient with opposite sign is seen across the southern `wind' component, suggestive of a helical magnetic field threading the outflow. Based on an analysis of the available radio and X-ray data, we conclude that the stratified radio outflow in NGC 4151 is magnetically-driven. The bi-conical radio `wind' is found to be massive ($1050-3200 M_\\odot$) with a high mass outflow rate ($0.01-0.03$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) but low in kinetic power ($<0.01$% of L$_{\\rm{bol}}$), making it less impactful for galactic-scale feedback. Our study suggests that radio-quiet AGN may also host magnetically dominant jets and winds, even while their jets are smaller and weaker compared to radio-loud AGN.",

    "title": "Blazars define a stable celestial reference frame",
    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that optical-radio position offsets and radio position variability are inversely correlated with the photometric variability of active galactic nuclei (AGN). A key prediction of these findings is that a reference frame constructed using highly photometrically variable AGN should be more stable than a frame that does not account for variability and that variability can be used to optimally weight all sources in order to maximize frame stability. Using ICRF3 matched to Gaia DR3, we employed a bootstrap method to estimate the multi-epoch stability of frames constructed using AGN selected at varying levels of photometric variability. We fit vector spherical harmonics to the coordinate differences between the three ICRF3 frames (S/X, K, and X/Ka) and Gaia and quantified the statistical dispersion as a function of blazar-like (high variability), quasar-like (low variability), and intermediate-variability class. An S/X reference frame constructed using blazars exceeds the stability of a frame constructed with quasars by a factor of 6 and is twice as stable as the ICRF3 defining sources. At K and X/Ka, a blazar-based frame matches or exceeds the stability of the defining sources by a factor of 1.4 in the case of X/Ka and exceeds the stability of a frame based on quasars by over a factor of 2 in both cases. The smaller improvement at K and X/Ka is likely because sources selected at higher frequency are more likely to be blazars. We derived a variability-based astrometric covariance scaling method that results in factor of 2 reduction in frame distortions and instabilities between S/X and Gaia, with a mild improvement for K but no difference for X/Ka, which is dominated by known distortions. Our results confirm the prediction that an optimal weighting of the link between the optical and radio celestial reference frames is enabled by accounting for photometric variability.",

    "abstract": "Simulations predict that supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) will exhibit periodic brightness variations that may exceed the stochastic variability intrinsic to active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this paper, we simulate SMBHBs with damped random walk (DRW) AGN variability and an added sinusoidal signal from the orbital motion, and test three methods -- the Generalized Lomb Scargle Periodogram (GLSP), the nested Bayesian sampler (NBS), and the Weighted Wavelet Z-Transform (WWZ) -- to determine which is best at recovering the periodicity. Our simulated light curves follow the properties of the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS), Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to best inform current and future SMBHB searches. We map a broad range of parameter space and identify which DRW-only light curves best mimic periodicity and pass each method's model selection. The NBS performs best at detecting periodicity and filtering out DRW-only light curves. Combined candidate selection with both the NBS and GLSP significantly reduces false positive rates with marginal impact to true positive rates. With this joint model selection pipeline, we find the lowest false positive rates in ZTF-like simulations and the highest detection rates in LSST-like simulations. Using a modified computation of the False Alarm Probability (FAP) with GLSP, we efficiently triage LSST AGN light curves (~10^7 light curves in ~10-30 hours) and achieve true- and false- positive rates of ~40% and ~0.5%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Cosmic voids have increasingly emerged as a powerful cosmological probe. However, their large spatial extent and intrinsically underdense environments make their identification highly sensitive to shot noise, redshift-space distortions (RSD), and observational systematics, particularly for topological and density-based void definitions. We introduce the Back-In-Time Void Finder (BitVF), a novel dynamical and physically motivated algorithm that identifies cosmic voids as regions of negative divergence of the Lagrangian displacement field reconstructed from the present-day tracer distribution. The reconstruction relies on an optimized discrete optimal transport algorithm that recovers the backward-in-time dynamics of tracers, naturally accounting for tracer bias without relying on cosmological assumptions. We validate BitVF against the widely used topological void finder REVOLVER using high-resolution N-body simulations, showing that it produces void catalogs with smoother and more physically motivated density profiles, as well as abundances that are more stable under tracer subsampling and shot noise. We further apply it to realistic DESI-like mock light-cone galaxy catalogs, demonstrating that it intrinsically mitigates redshift-space systematic effects, preserving real-space void size functions more faithfully than topological methods. Modeling RSD, the reconstruction can be combined with a fiducial cosmology and an assumed tracer bias within a bias-corrected Kaiser framework, yielding reconstructed-space void catalogs consistent with real-space statistics across redshift. Its performance is characterized as a function of the main internal parameters, showing an optimal balance between accuracy, computational efficiency, and applicability to stage IV galaxy surveys. BitVF will be publicly released within the CosmoBolognaLib.",

    "title": "Hierarchical bayesian inference: constraining population distribution of dark matter halo shapes via stellar streams",
    "abstract": "Stellar streams, the debris of tidally disrupted satellites, trace their host's gravitational potential and thus probe dark matter halo structure. While six-dimensional phase-space data of Galactic streams enable precise dark matter halo modelling in the Milky Way, streams around external galaxies are typically available only as low surface brightness features without kinematics (i.e. two-dimensional photometric data), providing only weak constraints when considered individually. We present a hierarchical Bayesian framework that infers the population distribution of halo flattening using only projected stream tracks. Streams are forward-modelled in StreaMAX, a new JAX-accelerated particle-spray package that achieves orders of magnitude faster stream generation when compared to traditional methods. For each stream we fit an axisymmetric dark matter halo model and obtain a posterior on the flattening. These posteriors are then combined through hierarchical reweighting to constrain the population distribution. Using mock data, we show that individual fits recover the correct flattening with modest precision and exhibit projection-induced multi-modalities. Nevertheless, aggregating these fits yields accurate and confident constraints on the underlying population distribution of dark matter halo morphologies, clearly distinguishing between oblate, spherical, and prolate populations. The total computational cost scales linearly with sample size. Our results demonstrate that ensembles of purely photometric streams carry sufficient information to constrain dark matter halo shapes in external galaxies at the population level. With the forthcoming samples from Euclid and Rubin/LSST, this approach offers a practical path to population-level inferences of halo morphology without any kinematic measurements.",

    "abstract": "We study the kinematics of condensations in 30 fields forming high-mass stars with ALMA at a high-resolution of ~0.08'' on average (~230 au). The presence of disks is important for feeding high-mass stars without feedback halting growth as their masses increase. In the search for velocity gradients resembling rotation that can reveal the presence of disks, we analyze the emission of gas tracers in 49 objects using CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CN, and tentative detections of HNCO and cis-HCOOH. Most of the velocity distributions show velocity gradients indicative of rotation. We reveal a total of 32 disk candidates, the largest sample to date that has been uniformly analyzed at a few hundred au scales in the high-mass regime. Their position-velocity maps are generally asymmetric with one side brighter than the opposite. We successfully fit a power law to the position-velocity maps of the disk candidates and find indices between -0.5 (Keplerian rotation) and -1 (rotation under specific angular momentum conservation) with a median of -0.7. Under Keplerian rotation assumption, we estimate central masses, uncorrected for inclination, ranging between 7 to 45 M$_\\odot$. Excluding outliers, the disk candidates are relatively more compact (<200 au) and less massive (<5 M$_\\odot$) than previous results at coarser angular resolution. We calculate an average Toomre-$Q$ parameter and find that most are gravitationally unstable (median of 0.5). We conclude that these observations offer the first opportunity to separate the disk and envelope components of hot cores on a statistically significant sample, and confirm that anisotropic collapse plays an role in feeding high-mass (proto)stars.",

    "abstract": "Radio observations offer a dust-unobscured view of galaxy star formation via the radio continuum-star formation rate (RC--SFR) relation. Emerging evidence of a stellar mass dependence in the RC--SFR relation raises the broader question of how other galaxy properties may influence this relation. In this work, we study the dependence of the global RC--SFR relation on galaxy properties in local ($z\\,\\leq$\\,0.3) star-forming galaxies (SFGs) using the second data release of the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS-DR2). Employing a non-parametric decision-tree regression algorithm, we identify the most important galaxy properties for estimating the radio luminosity using a sample of 18,828 emission-line-classified SFGs based on spectroscopic data from the SDSS-DR8. Along with the spectroscopically obtained SFRs and stellar mass values, we also use SFRs and stellar masses derived using photometric SED-fitting from the \\textit{GALEX}--SDSS--\\textit{WISE} Legacy Catalogue (GSWLC) for the same sample. We find that a galaxy's SFR is most important for predicting the radio luminosity, followed by the stellar mass, at $>5σ$ significance. Complementing the LoTSS catalogue 150\\,MHz flux densities with aperture photometry for the rest of the emission-line classified sample (35,099 galaxies in total), we obtain a new calibration of the RC--SFR relation, which does not change significantly whether we use spectroscopic or photometrically derived SFRs and stellar masses, despite the fact that the methods probe star formation on different characteristic timescales. Our results highlight the utility of decision-tree algorithms for handling censored radio-selected galaxy samples, which will be useful for future spectroscopic surveys of radio sources.",

    "abstract": "We report a detailed investigation of three intermediate-to-old age open clusters, Berkeley 17, Berkeley 18, and Berkeley 39, utilizing precise astrometric and photometric data from Gaia DR3. Cluster membership was robustly determined through a probabilistic proper-motion analysis, yielding statistically significant samples of 600, 1042, and 907 stars, respectively. From the mean parallaxes of these members, we determine astrometric distances ranging from approximately 3.40 kpc for Berkeley 17 to 5.80 kpc for Berkeley 18. Isochrone fitting applied to the decontaminated color-magnitude diagrams constrains the cluster ages to 9.12 +/- 1.00 Gyr, 3.36 +/- 0.50 Gyr, and 5.10 +/- 0.50 Gyr, respectively. Interstellar reddening spans a wide range, from E(B-V) = 0.17 mag in Berkeley 39 to 0.58 mag in Berkeley 17. Structural parameters derived from King model fits to the radial density profiles, combined with mass function analyses, indicate that the clusters are dynamically relaxed systems with mass distributions broadly consistent with the canonical Salpeter slope.

    "title": "A radially broad collisional cascade in the debris disk of $γ$ Ophiuchi observed by JWST",
    "abstract": "The A1V star $γ$ Oph, at a distance of 29.7 pc, is known from Spitzer imaging to host a debris disk with a large radial extent and from its spectral energy distribution to host inner warm dust. We imaged $γ$ Oph with JWST/MIRI at 15 and 25.5 microns, which reveal smooth and radially broad emission that extends to a radius of at least 250 au at 25.5 microns. In contrast to JWST findings of an inner small-grain component with distinct ringed substructures in Fomalhaut and Vega, the mid-infrared radial profile combined with prior ALMA imaging suggests a radially broad steady-state collisional cascade with the same grain size distribution throughout the disk. This further suggests that the system is populated by a radially broad planetesimal belt from tens of au or less to well over 200 au, rather than a narrow planetesimal belt from which the observed dust is displaced to appear broad. The disk is also found to be asymmetric, which could be modelled by a stellocentric offset corresponding to a small eccentricity of $\\sim$0.02. Such a disk eccentricity could be induced by a mildly eccentric $<$$10\\,M_\\mathrm{Jup}$ giant planet outside 10 au, or a more eccentric companion up to stellar mass at a few au, without producing a resolvable radial gap in the disk.",

    "title": "The baryonic mass-size relation of galaxies. II. Implications for the evolutionary paths between star-forming and passive galaxies",
    "abstract": "The baryonic mass-size relation of galaxies links the total baryonic mass (stars plus gas) to the baryonic half-mass radius. In the first paper of this series, we showed that star-forming galaxies from the SPARC sample follow two distinct relations in the baryonic mass-size plane: one defined by high-surface-density (HSD), star-dominated, Sa-to-Sc galaxies, and one defined by low-surface-density (LSD), gas-dominated, Sd-to-dI galaxies. In this second paper, we study the structural relations between baryonic mass, half-mass radius, and mean surface density to constrain possible morphological transformations between star-forming and passive galaxies. We complemented the SPARC sample with $\\sim$1200 passive galaxies that are nearly devoid of gas: ellipticals (Es), lenticulars (S0s), dwarf ellipticals (dEs) or dwarf spheroidals (dSphs), and the so-called `ultra-diffuse galaxies' (UDGs). Our results can be summarised as follows: (1) passive stellar components follow four distinct relations at high statistical significance, namely (i) ellipticals plus bulges, (ii) S0 disks, (iii) non-nucleated dwarfs (dEs, dSphs, UDGs), and (iv) nucleated dEs; (2) star-forming HSD disks (mostly Sa to Sc) overlap with S0 disks within 2$σ$ in the baryonic relations and within 1$σ$ in the stellar ones, so present-day spirals may simply evolve into lenticulars as they run out of gas; (3) star-forming LSD disks (mostly Sd to dI) are offset from non-nucleated passive dwarfs at more than 3$σ$ in the baryonic relations, but the two galaxy populations overlap within 1$σ$ in the stellar relations, suggesting that non-nucleated passive dwarfs may form from star-forming dwarfs only after gas removal; (4) UDGs extend the sequence of non-nucleated dEs/dSphs and may originate from the most diffuse star-forming LSD galaxies with no need for a substantial expansion of the stellar component.",

    "abstract": "We present the first high-resolution ($\\sim$ 0.14\") Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 dust continuum and CO molecular line emission observations of the quadruple system HD 34700. In particular, HD 34700AaAb is a spectroscopic binary ($M_{\\rm{bin}}=4\\,M_\\odot$) surrounded by two low-mass companions at large separations. Its circumbinary disk is highly substructured, featuring numerous spiral arms and a large cavity observed in infrared (IR) scattered light. We analyzed the CO line channel and intensity moment maps. By fitting a Keplerian model to the line channel emission, we identified the residual motions and conducted a line spectra analysis. We resolved an asymmetric continuum crescent on top of a dust ring at 0.39\" (138 au), colocated with the IR ring. The CO molecule line emissions trace a smaller cavity in gas, whose edge aligns with the inner rim of the ring detected in H$α$ emission at 0.20\" (65 au). The $^{12}$CO line emission and kinematics trace highly non-Keplerian motions ($\\sim0.1Δ\\upsilon_{\\rm kep}$), and these CO spiral features align well with the spiral structures in scattered light. The $^{12}$CO line spectra analysis reveals a streamer above the southeastern disk plane, likely falling onto the disk. The $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O kinematics largely follow the disk's underlying Keplerian rotation, while $^{13}$CO exhibits tentative signs of anticyclonic vortex flows at the continuum crescent location. Our multimolecular line study suggests that the circumbinary disk of HD 34700A is highly perturbed in its upper layers, possibly warped and influenced by infalling material. While late-stage infall may account for the IR spirals and the formation of the vortex through Rossby wave instability, an embedded massive companion within the cavity may also contribute to these features.",

    "title": "Transit distances and composition of low-velocity exocomets in the $β$ Pic system",
    "abstract": "$β$ Pictoris is a young nearby A5V star, about 20 Myr old, embedded in a prominent debris disc. For the past 40 years, variable absorption features have been observed in the stellar spectrum, produced by the gaseous tails of exocomets transiting the star. Yet, despite the large number of observations available, the origin and dynamical evolution of the exocomets remain poorly understood. Here we present new spectroscopic observations of $β$ Pic, obtained on April 29, 2025, with the Hubble Space Telescope and the HARPS spectrograph. We report the detection of three strong exocomet signatures at low radial velocities (-7.5, +2.5 and +10 km/s), in a large set of lines from various species and excitation levels. We show that the three exocometary tails have different excitation states, indicating that they are located at different distances from the star. Using a detailed modelling of the excitation state of the transiting gas, which includes both radiative and collisional excitation, we derive the transit distance of the three exocometary gaseous tails to be $0.88 \\pm 0.08$, $4.7 \\pm 0.3$, and $1.52 \\pm 0.15$ au. These values are much larger than previous estimates, which generally placed the transient features within 0.2 au. This reveals that gaseous tails produced by exocomets sublimating close to the star can expand and migrate over large distances, while still remaining detectable in absorption spectroscopy. Our study provides a new method to measure the transit distance of exocomets, based on excitation modelling, complementing the acceleration method only applicable for high-velocity objects.",

    "title": "The importance of super-Eddington black hole accretion for the emergence of massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift",
    "abstract": "Recent JWST observations indicate that massive quiescent galaxies (stellar mass $M_{*}\\gtrsim 10^{10}~\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$) at high redshift ($z\\gtrsim 6$) are more abundant than predicted by most existing galaxy formation simulations and semi-analytic models. Notably, the new COLIBRE simulations have succeeded in reconciling this tension, though the precise reason for their improved agreement with JWST data remains unclear. We demonstrate that the improved agreement is largely due to super-Eddington growth of supermassive black holes (BHs) at high redshift. We run a series of $(100~\\mathrm{cMpc})^{3}$ simulations with the COLIBRE subgrid physics, varying the maximum allowed BH accretion rate in units of the Eddington rate. We show that only the fiducial COLIBRE model, which permits super-Eddington accretion, is consistent with the JWST constraints at $z \\gtrsim 6$. Moreover, we find that in COLIBRE about $50$ per cent of BH mass growth at high redshift occurs in the super-Eddington regime, even though such events are extremely rare in time. Our work highlights the important role of super-Eddington accretion in simulations of galaxy formation for reproducing the observed early emergence of quenching of massive galaxies.",

    "abstract": "The detection of strong, large-scale magnetic fields at the surface of only the oldest population of white dwarfs might point towards a hidden internal magnetic field slowly rising to the surface. In addition, strong magnetic fields have recently been measured through asteroseismology in the radiative interiors of red giant stars, the progenitors of white dwarfs. To investigate the potential connection between these observations, we revisit the fossil field framework by using the asteroseismic detections to constrain the strength of such magnetic fields as they evolve to the white dwarf stage. We assume that the magnetic field was either created during the main sequence core convection or that it fills the radiative interior as the star evolves on the red giant branch. From these, we evolve the magnetic flux, allowing for magnetic diffusion along the evolution of a 1.5Msun modelled star. We find that measured field strengths in red giants attributed to the hydrogen-burning shell are compatible with the field amplitudes and emergence timescales of magnetized white dwarfs. On the contrary, magnetic fields generated solely from a convective-core dynamo on the main-sequence and detectable during the red giant branch would be buried too deep in the star and not match the breakout timescales and the field strengths of magnetic white dwarfs. A broadly magnetized internal radiative zone during the red giant branch is therefore key for the fossil field theory to connect magnetic fields observed along the late evolution of stars.",

The detection of sodium in olivine cores has previously suggested very high saturating partial pressures of gaseous sodium, but we show that alkalis were lost during heating and recondensed at lower temperatures, essentially in the present-day chondrule mesostases. This recondensation was accompanied by mass-dependent enrichment in light isotopes (for multi-isotope alkalis such as K and Rb), but its limited extent indicates a cooling acceleration (or \"quenching\"). The isotopic fractionation also constrains the ratio of the chondrule density and the cooling rate prior to the quench around $10^{-6}\\:\\mathrm{kg.m^{-3}.K^{-1}.h}$ suggesting densities above $\\sim 10^{-6}\\:\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$.

This method proves particularly useful when inverting the computations to derive the non-uniform entries of the arbitrary load, given the minimum number of EEPs necessary, which disposes of the redundancy of other matrix-based computations and leads to numerically stable impedance fault calculation. As the EEPs are envisioned to be obtained primarily through measurement, our method is also tested with the inclusion of various noise components and its convergence is evaluated, suggesting the minimum SNR and fading level of the measurement apparatus, as well as the optimal choice of reference antenna to minimise the estimation error.",

    "abstract": "Aims. We investigate the radio loudness ($\\mathcal{R}$) distribution in a large, homogeneous sample of radio galaxies. Methods. The sample is composed of galaxies from the ROGUE I/II catalogue belonging to the SDSS MGS and is divided into optically inactive radio galaxies (OPIRGs), optically active ones (OPARGs) and radio Seyferts. We use optical, mid-infrared and radio data to calculate the AGN bolometric luminosities, accretion rate ($λ$), black-hole mass ($M_{BH}$) and $\\mathcal{R}$. Results. Contrary to some previous studies based on restricted samples, using our complete sample of objects with redshifts $z < 0.4$, we find no evidence of bimodality in $\\mathcal{R}$. The highest $\\mathcal{R}$ values are associated with extended radio structures. $\\mathcal{R}$ is anti-correlated with $λ$, and spans about 2 dex at fixed $λ$. Radio Seyferts, OPARGs and OPIRGs form a sequence of increasing $M_{BH}$ with substantial overlap. Radio Seyferts show no $\\mathcal{R}$-$M_{BH}$ correlation, whereas OPARGs and OPIRGs show a weak positive trend. From theoretical considerations, the observed two-dex spread in radio luminosity and $\\mathcal{R}$ can be reproduced by a four-fold variation in the dimensionless magnetic flux $\\varphi$ assuming realistic black-hole spins. Conclusions. The smooth distribution of radio loudness supports a common evolutionary path for all radio sources, with black-hole spin and magnetic field varying continuously. The radio loudness depends on black-hole mass and accretion rate, while moderate variations in $\\varphi$ may account for the observed scatter in this relation.",

The collapsar and CEJSN r-process scenario might also contribute to the lighter r-process elements, and the binary neutron star (NS-NS) merger r-process scenario might contribute to the third r-process peak. The magnetar, the wind from the newly born NS, and the accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf r-process scenarios fall short in explaining observations. They might exist, but cannot be major contributors to the r-process in the early Universe. To constrain r-process scenarios in the early Universe, I require that they explain the large scatter in the r-process abundances of very metal-poor stars, account for the correlation between light r-process nucleosynthesis and iron production, and the lack of correlation between the third peak r-process production and iron production, as inferred from very metal-poor stars.

    "title": "Probing Heavily Obscured AGN in Major Galaxy Mergers Using the mm-X-ray Correlation",
    "abstract": "The study of heavily obscured supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth in late-stage galaxy mergers is challenging: column densities $N_{\\mathrm{H}}>10^{24},\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ can block most nuclear emission, leaving significant gaps in the SMBH growth census. Millimeter-wave continuum emission offers a potential window into this obscured phase, as it can trace Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) activity through mechanisms less affected by dust extinction. In this work, we test whether the observed correlation between millimeter ($\\sim200,\\mathrm{GHz}$) and hard X-ray (14 - 150,keV) luminosities can be used to plausibly identify hidden AGN in local (Ultra)Luminous Infrared Galaxies (U)LIRGs, including systems hosting confirmed dual AGN. We identify three sources -- one confirmed AGN and two strong candidates -- presenting significant evidence of AGN activity. The confirmed dual AGN lie within $\\sim3σ$ of the mm--X-ray correlation, suggesting this relation can be used to identify hidden pairs. By combining the position of each source relative to this correlation with independent star formation rate constraints, we propose a method to disentangle AGN and star formation contributions for sources with measured column densities. While our analysis is based on a small, heterogeneous local sample and relies on empirical scaling relations, these results indicate that millimeter continuum emission may provide a useful complementary diagnostic for obscured SMBH growth. ALMA observations at high angular resolutions are particularly valuable for this approach, while future facilities such as the ngVLA will be essential to test its robustness in larger and more distant samples.",

    "title": "A Theory of transmission spectroscopy of planetary winds: Spectral-line saturation and limits on mass-loss inference",
    "abstract": "Transmission spectroscopy is a key technique in the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres and has been widely applied to planets undergoing hydrodynamic escape. While a robust analytic theory exists for transmission spectra of hydrostatic atmospheres, the corresponding interpretation for escaping atmospheres has so far relied on numerical modeling. In this work, we develop a theory of transmission spectroscopy in hydrodynamically escaping atmospheres by coupling the standard transmission geometry to a steady-state, spherically symmetric, isothermal outflow. This approach yields closed-form expressions and allows the optical depth inversion problem to be examined. The analytic solution reveals that transmission spectroscopy of planetary winds naturally separates into two regimes. In an opacity-limited regime, transmission depths retain sensitivity to the atmospheric mass-loss rate. Beyond a critical threshold, however, spectral-line cores become saturated and no longer provide a unique constraint on the mass flux. This transition is marked by a sharp analytic boundary of the form $σ(λ)\\times \\dot M \\le C_{sat}$, where $C_{sat}$ is a constant set by the thermodynamic and geometric properties of the wind. This condition specifies when the inversion between transmission depth and mass-loss rate admits a real solution. Once it is violated, the effective transit radius is no longer controlled by opacity or mass loss, but by the geometric extent of the absorbing wind. These results demonstrate that spectral-line saturation in transmission spectroscopy corresponds to a fundamental loss of invertibility between absorption and atmospheric mass loss, rather than a gradual weakening of sensitivity. The theory provides a physically transparent explanation for why strong transmission line cores often fail to constrain mass-loss rates, while weaker lines and line wings remain diagnostic.",

    "title": "Properties and Possible Physical Origins of $γ$-ray Emission in Extreme Synchrotron Blazars",
    "abstract": "Extreme synchrotron blazars, characterized by a first peak in their broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at frequencies exceeding $10^{17}$ Hz, often exhibit a second peak beyond 1~TeV. These sources serve as ideal laboratories for studying particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms in relativistic jets. In this work, we systematically analyze the $\\sim$16-year Fermi-LAT observational data for 25 extreme high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs (EHBLs). The results indicate that the majority of these sources display stable or low flux levels in the GeV band, with only 6 sources showing significant variability at a confidence level exceeding 5$σ$. The time-averaged spectra over the 16-year period for most EHBLs are well described by a hard power-law model, with photon indices predominantly clustered between 1.7 and 1.8. Using Fermi-LAT data in conjunction with multiwavelength observations compiled from the literature, we construct broadband SEDs for these EHBLs and fit them with a one-zone synchrotron + synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) model. We find that this simplified theoretical framework is sufficient for modeling the observed SEDs of most of these EHBLs, albeit requiring relatively higher electron energies compared to other $γ$-ray emitting HBLs, and at times under-representing the UV emission. Based on the SED fitting results, we investigate the physical properties of the emission regions in these EHBLs and compare them with those of other $γ$-ray emitting HBLs. Consistent with other GeV--TeV $γ$-ray-emitting BL Lacs, the jets in these EHBLs are marked by low radiation efficiency and low magnetization.",

    "abstract": "In a recent publication [R. C. Tautz and I. Lerche, Res. Astron. Astrophys. 16, 162 (2016); arXiv:1606.08272], the authors present a derivation of the Green's function for the three-dimensional telegraph equation (also known as the heat wave equation, or relativistic heat conduction equation). We demonstrate that the closed-form expression derived in their Appendix A is incorrect. Specifically, the published solution lacks a Dirac delta term representing the ballistic wavefront and contains an algebraic error in the prefactor of the wake term. These omissions arise from the neglect of distributional derivatives when differentiating a Heaviside step function. We provide a rigorous derivation of the Green's function using the Fourier transform method, verify the correct limiting behavior as the damping vanishes, and pinpoint the exact mathematical step where the original derivation failed.",
